Microsoft Azure CLI 'AI Examples' Extension
==========================================

Improve user experience by adding AI powered examples to command help content.

This extension changes the default examples provided when calling `-h` or `--help` on a command, such as `az vm create -h`, with ones selected by an AI powered service. The service provides examples based on Azure usage, internet sources, and other factors.
