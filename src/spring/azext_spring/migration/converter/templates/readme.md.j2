This README provides instructions on how to use the Bicep files generated from your Azure Spring Apps service to provision an Azure Container Apps environment, including the necessary resources and containerized applications. Additionally, some configuration updates must be made manually by referencing public Azure documentation after deploying the Bicep files.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Azure Subscription: An active Azure subscription.

2. Azure CLI: Installed and authenticated. You can download it here.

3. Bicep CLI: Installed and available. Installation steps are available here.

4. Permissions: Sufficient permissions to create and manage resources in your Azure subscription.

## Steps to Deploy Azure Container Apps Using Bicep Files

1. Review and Customize Bicep Files

Open the Bicep files generated in the directory and review the parameters and resource definitions. Modify parameter values as needed to align with your environment (e.g., resource group name, location, application names).

2. [Optional] Create a new Resource Group

If the resource group specified in the Bicep files does not already exist, create one:

az group create --name <resource-group-name> --location <location>

Replace the "*" with the correct credentials in config server bicep file

3. Deploy the Bicep Files

Deploy the Bicep files using the Azure CLI:

az deployment group create \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --template-file main.bicep \
  --parameters param.bicepparam

Replace <parameters-file>.json with the path to your parameter file.

5. Validate Deployment

After deployment, validate that all resources, including the Azure Container Apps environment and applications, are correctly provisioned. You can check this in the Azure Portal or using the Azure CLI:

az containerapp list --resource-group <resource-group-name>

## Post-Deployment Configuration

Some properties and configurations are not included in the Bicep files and must be manually updated. Refer to the official Azure documentation for detailed steps:

### Networking

### Scaling Settings: Configure scaling policies following Configure Scaling.
