For each parameter, consider:

Configurability: Should users be able to modify this in production? Make it configurable if it needs runtime changes or environment-specific values. Keep it fixed for security settings, system IDs, or compliance requirements.

Management: Is this an IT or OT concern? 
- IT handles security, infrastructure, and compliance
- OT manages daily operations and production settings

Hierarchy: Where should this be configured? Higher levels for broad impact settings and security. Lower levels for local operations and tuning.

Required Status: Does this need a value in the template? Mark as required if it:
- Has security/behavioral impact
- Lacks a default value
- Is critical for operation
- Has compliance requirements

Think about these in the context of a production environment where both security and operational flexibility are important.
