Pods for deployment api-server in namespace-78a are pending because a resource quota named compute-quota requires limits.cpu to be 
set for each container. The deployment only specifies limits.memory and omits limits.cpu.                                          

To fix: Add a limits.cpu value to the container spec in the deployment. Example:                                                   

                                                                                                                                   
 resources:                                                                                                                        
   limits:                                                                                                                         
     cpu: 100m                                                                                                                     
     memory: 64Mi                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                   

Then redeploy.
