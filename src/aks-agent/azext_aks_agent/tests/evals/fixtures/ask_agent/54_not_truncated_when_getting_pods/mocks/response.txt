Namespace namespace-54b on robusta-prod cluster has pod fast-fail-pod stuck in ImagePullBackOff.                                   

Root cause: Pod is trying to pull image totallynonexistentregistry12345.io/doesnotexist/invalid:latest, which does not exist. DNS  
lookup for registry fails: "no such host".                                                                                         

Fix: Update pod spec to use a valid image from an accessible registry.
