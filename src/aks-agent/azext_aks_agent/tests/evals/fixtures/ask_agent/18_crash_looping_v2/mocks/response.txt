 ERROR - SSL certificate expired                                                                                                   
 ExpiredCertException: Certificate expired on 2024-08-03 17:00:08                                                                  
                                                                                                                                   

Root cause: Secret db-certs-config (used for certs) is missing, and the certificate is expired.                                    

Fix: Create/update the db-certs-config secret with a valid certificate and key. Then restart the deployment.
