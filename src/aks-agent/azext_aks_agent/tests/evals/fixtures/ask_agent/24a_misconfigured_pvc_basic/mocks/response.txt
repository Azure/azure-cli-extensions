Redis pod is stuck in Pending because its PersistentVolumeClaim redis-standard-pvc is also Pending. No storage has been provisioned
for the PVC, so the pod cannot start.                                                                                              

To fix: Check if a storage class named standard-v2 exists and is properly configured, and ensure your cluster has a storage        
provider that can dynamically provision volumes.
