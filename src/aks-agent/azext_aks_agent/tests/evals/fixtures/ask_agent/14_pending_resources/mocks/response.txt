Pod user-profile-resources-659d4dd659-xch7g in default namespace is stuck in Pending state.                                        

Reason: No nodes have enough resources for its requests:                                                                           

 • CPU: 3 cores                                                                                                                    
 • Memory: 5Gi                                                                                                                     
 • GPU: 5 (nvidia.com/gpu)                                                                                                         

All 3 nodes lack sufficient CPU, memory, and GPU. No preemption victims found.                                                     

To fix: Lower resource requests or add nodes with more CPU, memory, and GPU.
