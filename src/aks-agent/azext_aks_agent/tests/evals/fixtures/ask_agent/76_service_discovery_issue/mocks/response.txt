Frontend pod can't connect to backend service because the backend-service has no endpoints. The service selector is                
app=backend,version=v2, but the backend deployment pods are labeled app=backend,version=v1. No pods match the service selector, so 
no traffic is routed.                                                                                                              

Fix: Update backend-service selector to match backend pod labels (app=backend,version=v1) or update backend pod labels to          
version=v2.
