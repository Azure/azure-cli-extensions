payment-processing-worker-747ccfb9db-tl5gf is crashing due to missing DEPLOY_ENV environment variable.                             

Crash reason: Container command checks if DEPLOY_ENV is set. If not, it prints "Environment variable DEPLOY_ENV is undefined" and  
exits. No DEPLOY_ENV is defined, so the container exits immediately, causing CrashLoopBackOff.                                     

Fix: Set DEPLOY_ENV environment variable in the deployment spec.
