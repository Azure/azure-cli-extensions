monitoring-agent in namespace-81 gets permission denied errors because its service account (monitoring-sa) only has "get"          
permission on pods, not "list". The pod tries to "list" pods, but the Role (monitoring-role) does not grant "list" for podsâ€”only   
"get".                                                                                                                             

To fix: Update monitoring-role to include "list" verb for pods. Example:

Apply the updated Role to resolve the permission denied error.
