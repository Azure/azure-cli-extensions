yourcompany/crw:latest.                                                                                                            

Root cause: Kubernetes cannot pull the container image yourcompany/crw:latest. This is likely due to one of:                       

 1 Image does not exist in the registry.                                                                                           
 2 Image registry credentials are missing or incorrect.                                                                            
 3 Network or permission issue accessing the registry.                                                                             

Fix: Verify the image exists and is accessible, and check imagePullSecrets if a private registry is used.
