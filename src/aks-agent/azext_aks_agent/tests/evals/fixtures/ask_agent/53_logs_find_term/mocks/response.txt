 • SQL syntax error near 'SELCT' at line 1 (typo in 'SELECT')                                                                      
 • Duplicate entry '12345' for key 'users.PRIMARY'                                                                                 

Root causes:                                                                                                                       

 1 Application is issuing malformed SQL queries ("SELCT" instead of "SELECT").                                                     
 2 Application is trying to insert duplicate primary keys into the users table.                                                    

Fix:                                                                                                                               

 • Correct SQL query typos in application code.                                                                                    
 • Ensure logic prevents duplicate primary key inserts.
