# Microsoft Azure CLI 'aosm' Extension

This package is for the 'aosm' extension to support Azure Operator Service Manager 
functions.
i.e. `az aosm`

## Background

The `az aosm` extension is intended to provide support for working with AOSM
resources and definitions. Currently it only implements commands which aid the
process of publishing Network Function Definitions and Network Service Designs to
use with Azure Operator Service Manager or Network Function Manager.

## Installation

Eventually the extension will be published through the usual process and it will be
installed as usual, via `az extension add --name aosm`

Until then, the latest development version can be found here:
https://github.com/jddarby/azure-cli-extensions/releases/download/aosm-extension/aosm-0.2.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl

To install, download this wheel and run:
`az extension add --source path/to/aosm-0.2.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl`

## Updating 

We are currently not bumping versions, so if you would like the most up to date version of the CLI. You should run:
'az extension remove --name aosm'

And then re-add with the new wheel, as detailed in Installation above. 

# nfd and nsd commands

These commands help with the publishing of Network Function Definition and Network
Service Design resources.

## Overview of function
A generic workflow of using the tool would be:
- Find the pre-requisite items you require for your use-case
- Run a `generate-config` command to output an example JSON config file for subsequent commands
- Fill in the config file
- Run a `build` command to output one or more bicep templates for your Network Function Definition or Network Service Design
- Review the output of the build command, edit the output as necessary for your requirements
- Run a `publish` command to:
    * Create all pre-requisite resources such as Resource Group, Publisher, Artifact Stores, Groups
    * Deploy those bicep templates
    * Upload artifacts to the artifact stores

### Pre-requisites

#### VNFs

For VNFs, you will need a single ARM template which would create the Azure resources
for your VNF, for example a Virtual Machine, disks and NICs. You'll also need a VHD
image that would be used for the VNF Virtual Machine.

#### CNFs

For CNFs you must have the `helm` package installed on the machine you are running the CLI from. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

For CNFs, you must provide:
* helm packages with an associated schema. These files must be on your disk and will be referenced in the `input.json` config file. 
* a reference to an existing Azure Container Registry which contains the images for your CNF. Currently, only one ACR is supported per CNF. The images to be copied from this ACR are populated automatically based on the helm package schema.
* optionally, you can provide a file (on disk) path_to_mappings which is a copy of values.yaml with your chosen values replaced by deployment parameters, thus exposing them as parameters to the CNF. You can get this file auto-generated by leaving the value as a blank string, either having every value as a deployment parameter, or using `--interactive` to interactively choose.
When filling in the input.json file, you must list helm packages in the order they are to be deployed. For example, if A must be deployed before B, your input.json should look something like this:

        "helm_packages": [
            {
                "name": "A",
                "path_to_chart": "Path to package A",
                "path_to_mappings": "Path to package A mappings",
                "depends_on": [
                    "Names of the Helm packages this package depends on"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "B",
                "path_to_chart": "Path to package B",
                "path_to_mappings": "Path to package B mappings",
                "depends_on": [
                    "Names of the Helm packages this package depends on"
                ]
            },

#### NSDs
For NSDs, you will need to have a Resource Group with a deployed Publisher, Artifact Store, Network Function Definition and Network Function Definition Version. You can use the `az aosm nfd` commands to create all of these resources.


### Command examples

#### NFDs

Get help on command arguments

`az aosm -h`
`az aosm nfd -h`
`az aosm nfd build -h`
etc...

All these commands take a `--definition-type` argument of `vnf` or `cnf`

Create an example config file for building a definition

`az aosm nfd generate-config`

This will output a file called `input.json` which must be filled in. 
Once the config file has been filled in the following commands can be run.

Build an nfd definition locally

`az aosm nfd build --config-file input.json`

More options on building an nfd definition locally:

Choose which of the VNF ARM template parameters you want to expose as NFD deploymentParameters, with the option of interactively choosing each one.

`az aosm nfd build --config-file input.json --definition_type vnf --order_params`
`az aosm nfd build --config-file input.json --definition_type vnf --order_params --interactive`

Choose which of the CNF Helm values parameters you want to expose as NFD deploymentParameters.

`az aosm nfd build --config-file input.json --definition_type cnf [--interactive]`

Publish a pre-built definition

`az aosm nfd publish --config-file input.json`

Delete a published definition

`az aosm nfd delete --config-file input.json`

Delete a published definition and the publisher, artifact stores and NFD group

`az aosm nfd delete --config-file input.json --clean`

#### NSDs

Get help on command arguments

`az aosm -h`
`az aosm nsd -h`
`az aosm nsd build -h`
etc...

Create an example config file for building a definition

`az aosm nsd generate-config`

This will output a file called `input.json` which must be filled in. 
Once the config file has been filled in the following commands can be run.

Build an nsd locally

`az aosm nsd build --config-file input.json`

Publish a pre-built design

`az aosm nsd publish --config-file input.json`

Delete a published design

`az aosm nsd delete --config-file input.json`

Delete a published design and the publisher, artifact stores and NSD group

`az aosm nsd delete --config-file input.json --clean`

## Bug Reporting

Especially as this extension is still in development, you may encounter bugs or
usability issues as you try to use it in its current form. It would be much
appreciated if you could report these so that we're aware of them!

The (Microsoft internal) process for bug reporting during development is here:
https://eng.ms/docs/strategic-missions-and-technologies/strategic-missions-and-technologies-organization/azure-for-operators/aiops/aiops-orchestration/aosm-product-docs/processes/bug_process

CLI issues should be tagged and triaged as UX bugs.

## Logging

The CLI uses the standard Azure CLI logging mechanism. To enable logging to the console, you can use the following flags depending on the desired level of logging:
- `--verbose` - This flag changes the logging level to Info and above.
- `--debug` - This flag changes the logging level to Debug and above.
- `--only-show-errors` - This flag changes the logging level to Error only, suppressing Warning.

It is also possible to enable logging to file by running the following command:
```
az config set logging.enable_log_file=true
```
This will create a log file in the `~/.azure/logs` directory. 

**Note:** The above command will enable logging for all Azure CLI commands until the logging is disabled again by the user. Not disabling file logging could slow down the performance of the CLI. To disable file logging, run the following command:
```
az config set logging.enable_log_file=false
```

## Development

Information about setting up and maintaining a development environment for this extension can be found [here](./development.md).
