# V1beta1DeviceConstraint

DeviceConstraint must have exactly one field set besides Requests.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**match_attribute** | **str** | MatchAttribute requires that all devices in question have this attribute and that its type and value are the same across those devices.  For example, if you specified \&quot;dra.example.com/numa\&quot; (a hypothetical example!), then only devices in the same NUMA node will be chosen. A device which does not have that attribute will not be chosen. All devices should use a value of the same type for this attribute because that is part of its specification, but if one device doesn&#39;t, then it also will not be chosen.  Must include the domain qualifier. | [optional] 
**requests** | **list[str]** | Requests is a list of the one or more requests in this claim which must co-satisfy this constraint. If a request is fulfilled by multiple devices, then all of the devices must satisfy the constraint. If this is not specified, this constraint applies to all requests in this claim. | [optional]
