            Azure ML datastores securely link your Azure storage services to your workspace so that you can
            access your storage without having to hardcode the connection information into your scripts.
            The connection secrets, like the storage service's authentication credentials, are stored in your
            workspace's Key Vault.


            When you create a workspace, an Azure Storage account is automatically created as an associated
            resource. A blob container is created in this account, and its connection information is stored
            as a datastore named 'workspaceblobstore'. This serves as the workspace's default datastore,
            and the blob container is used to store your workspace artifacts and machine learning job logs
            and outputs.
