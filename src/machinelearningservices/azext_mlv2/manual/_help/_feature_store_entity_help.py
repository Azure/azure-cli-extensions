            feature-store entities can be defined from files on your local machine. The created feature store entity will be tracked
            in the feature store under the specified name and version.


            To create a feature store entity from file(s) on your local machine, specify the 'path'
            field in your YAML config. Azure ML will upload these file(s) to the blob container
            that backs the feature store's default datastore (named 'workspaceblobstore'). The created
            feature store entity will then point to that uploaded feature store entity.


        examples:
        - name: Create a feature store entity from a YAML specification file
          text: az ml feature-store-entity create --file feature-store-entity.yml --resource-group my-resource-group --feature-store-name my-feature-store
