        services (the &quot;<u>Domain Name Registration Services</u>&quot; or the
        &quot;<u>Services</u>&quot;). The terms &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or

        discretion, may change or modify this Agreement, and any policies or agreements

        \ In addition, Azure may occasionally notify you of changes or modifications
        to this Agreement by email.  It is therefore very important that you keep
        your shopper account (\u201C<u>Shopper Account</u>\u201D) information, including
        your email address, current.  Azure assumes no liability or responsibility
        for your failure to receive an email notification if such failure results

        \       <strong><strong>2. PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO ALL REGISTRATIONS</strong>
        \ </strong>\\n\\n      <p><p><em>Unless otherwise noted, the provisions below
        in this Section 2 are generally applicable to all TLDs that we offer.  Special
        provisions specific to any TLD or ccTLD (those in addition to posted Registry
        Policies) are identified elsewhere below in this Agreement.</em>  \\r</p>\\n<ol><li><em><u>Registry
        Policies.</u></em> You agree to be bound by all Registry Policies (defined
        above in this Agreement) applicable to your domain name registration (at any
        level). IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO VISIT THE APPLICABLE TLD SITE AND READ
        AND REVIEW ALL APPLICABLE REGISTRY POLICIES PRIOR TO YOUR REGISTRATION IN
        THE TLD.  REGISTRY POLICIES FOR EACH TLD CAN BE FOUND BY VISITING THE CORRESPONDING
        TLD LINK LISTED[HERE](https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/tld-registry-policies?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456|tld-registry-policies).
        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Registry Operator
        of the TLD in which the domain name registration is made is and shall be an
        intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement. As such the parties to
        this agreement acknowledge and agree that the third party beneficiary rights
        of the Registry Operator have vested and that the Registry Operator has relied
        on its third party beneficiary rights under this Agreement in agreeing to
        Azure being a registrar for the respective TLD. The third party beneficiary
        rights of the Registry Operator will survive any termination of this Agreement.</li>
        </ol> </p>\\n      <p><ol start=2><li><em><u>Registration Requirements.</u></em>
        To the extent any TLD or ccTLD requires you meet eligibility (e.g., residency
        for .JP, .EU, etc.), validation (e.g., DNS validation) or other authentication
        requirements as a condition to registering a domain name in the TLD, you agree
        that by submitting an application or registering or renewing your domain name,
        you represent and warrant that: (a) all information provided to register or
        renew the domain name (including all supporting documents, if any) is true,
        complete and correct, and is not misleading in any way, and the application
        is made in good faith; (b) you meet, and will continue to meet, the eligibility
        criteria prescribed in the Registry Policies for the applicable TLD for the
        duration of the domain name registration; (c) you have not previously submitted
        an application for the domain name with another registrar using the same eligibility
        criteria, and the other registrar has rejected the application (if applicable);
        (d) you acknowledge and agree that even if the domain name is accepted for
        registration, your entitlement to register the domain name may be challenged
        by others who claim to have an entitlement to the domain name; and (e) you
        acknowledge and agree that the Registry or the registrar can cancel the registration
        of the domain name if any of the warranties required are found to be untrue,
        incomplete, incorrect or misleading.</li></ol></p>\\n      <p><ol start=3><li><em><u>Ownership.</u></em>
        You acknowledge and agree that registration of a domain name does not create
        any proprietary right for you, the registrar, or any other person in the name
        used as a domain name or the domain name registration and that the entry of
        a domain name in the Registry shall not be construed as evidence or ownership
        of the domain name registered as a domain name. You shall not in any way transfer
        or purport to transfer a proprietary right in any domain name registration
        or grant or purport to grant as security or in any other manner encumber or
        purport to encumber a domain name registration.</li></ol></p>\\n      <p><ol
        start=4><li><em><u>ICANN Requirements.</u></em> You agree to comply with the
        ICANN requirements, standards, policies, procedures, and practices for which
        each applicable Registry Operator has monitoring responsibility in accordance
        with the Registry Agreement between ICANN and itself or any other arrangement
        with ICANN. For additional ICANN-related helpful information, please see <a

        their subcontractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, divisions, shareholders, directors,
        officers, employees, accountants, attorneys, insurers, agents, predecessors,

        FEES AND PAYMENTS</strong></strong>\\n\\n      <p><p><strong>(A) GENERAL TERMS,

        all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained at this Site at
        the time you order the Services.  Azure expressly reserves the right to change
        or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications
        shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need
        for further notice to you.  If you have purchased or obtained Services for
        a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall
        be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further
        described below.   \\r</p>\\n<p>Unless otherwise specifically noted (for reasons
        such as those highlighted in Section 2(x) above), the renewal price for any
        domain name in any TLD will be the same as the list (non-sale) price shown
        when you search for and select a domain, and again in the cart prior to purchase.
        \ For example, if the list price is $9.99, and a different renewal price is
        not specifically identified, then the renewal price is also $9.99.  Likewise,
        if a domain name has a sale price of $8.99, with the list (non-sale) price
        shown (as a strike-through) at $9.99, the renewal price will be $9.99*.  \\r</p>\\n<p><small>*
        Renewal price subject to change prior to actual date of renewal.</small>  \\r</p>\\n<p>For
        all other terms and conditions relating to fees, payment, refund and billing,
        etc. applicable to the Services offered under the scope of this Agreement,
        please refer to the \u201CFees and Payments\u201D section of our <a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/universal-terms-of-service-agreement?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Universal
        Terms of Service</a>.   \\r</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(B) DOMAIN NAME
        RENEWAL TERMS</strong></p>\\n<p>When you register a domain name, you will
        have the following renewal options: </p>\\n<ol><li><em>Automatic Renewal.</em>
        Automatic Renewal is the default setting. Domain names will automatically
        renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name
        registration, and payment will be taken from the Payment Method you have on
        file with Azure, at Azure's then current rates. Thus, if you have chosen to
        register your domain name for one (1) year, Azure will automatically renew
        it for one (1) year. If you have chosen to register your domain name for two
        (2) years, Azure will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.
        If you wish to change your automatic renewal term to a different period from
        your original term,  as of 16 July 2020, you may manually renew the domain
        registration to establish a new default automatic renewal term for the domain.</li></ol>\\r\\n</p>\\n
        \     <p><ol start=2><li><em>Manual Renewal.</em>  If you have elected to
        turn off automatic renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel the domain
        name registration) effective at expiration of the then current term, you may
        nonetheless elect to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its
        expiration date by logging into your [Account Manager](https://account.secureserver.net?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456)
        and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service (should
        you in fact want the domain name to be renewed). If you fail to manually implement
        the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled
        and you will no longer have use of that name.</li></ol></p>\\n      <p>All
        renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it may be amended
        from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms
        of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.  Domain name renewals
        will be non-refundable. In the event that we are unable to automatically renew
        your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we may automatically
        renew your domain name for a period less than your original registration period
        to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed. If for any reason
        Azure is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method you have on
        file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name registration
        will expire. It is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method information
        current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card.

        .vg), renewal will occur, or must occur manually if the product was previously
        cancelled, no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date,
        or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status. For some ccTLDs
        (.es) renewal must be processed no later than seven days before the expiration
        date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.  When the
        domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by
        calling Azure and requesting that the domain name be renewed. You cannot renew
        the domain name through your <a href=\\\"https://account.secureserver.net?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Account
        Manager</a>. If you fail to manually implement the renewal of any cancelled
        product before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and
        you will no longer have use of that name.  \\r</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p>You agree
        that Azure will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail
        to renew in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement. In any case, if you
        fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may
        apply. If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any
        other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services
        will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for
        renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you
        cancel in advance. </p>\\n      <p><p>If you fail to renew your domain name
        in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that Azure may, in
        its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf. If Azure
        decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a
        Renewal Grace Period during which you must reimburse Azure for the renewal
        and keep your domain name. The Renewal Grace Period is currently twelve (12)
        days but subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. </p>\\n<p>For

        .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg) there is no Renewal Grace Period
        after the expiration date of the domain name. If you do not reimburse Azure
        for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed
        on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption
        period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject
        to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay Azure a Redemption fee.
        </p>\\n<p>The Redemption fee is displayed at checkout and is subject to change
        under the terms of this Agreement. If you do not redeem your domain name prior
        to the end of the 30-day redemption period Azure may, in its sole discretion,
        delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.
        \ During the redemption period your domain name may be parked.</p>\\n</p>\\n
        \     <p><p>If your domain name is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30-day
        Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay Azure a redemption fee and
        redeem your domain name. The redemption fee is displayed at checkout and is

        you may not change the account associated with such free domain for the first
        five (5) days after registration.  In the event a free domain name is offered
        with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered
        fails, then we may, in our sole discretion, either delete the registration
        of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the

        Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as you have any
        domain name registered through Azure.  \\r</p>\\n      <p>You agree that you
        will not transfer any domain name registered through Azure to another domain
        name registrar during the first sixty (60) days after its initial registration
        date.  You agree that you may not transfer any domain name for ten (10) days
        after a Change of Account.  \\r</p>\\n      <p>You further agree that you

        period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain name and get a
        full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the marketability
        or viability of a domain name.  If Azure determines (which determination shall
        be made by Azure in its sole and absolute discretion) that you have been engaging
        in &quot;domain tasting&quot;, then Azure reserves the right to (a) charge
        you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any refund issued) or (b)
        refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether. Azure will not charge
        you a fee if Azure cancels your domain name during the five (5) day grace
        period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control.</p>\\n      <p>You
        agree that Azure shall not be bound by (i) any representations made by third
        parties who you may use to purchase services from Azure, or (ii) any statements
        of a general nature, which may be posted on Azure's website or contained in
        Azure's promotional materials.</p>\\n        <strong><strong>5. UP TO DATE

        you provided as part of the application and/or registration process changes.

        status. Failure by you, for whatever reason, to provide Azure with accurate
        and reliable information on an initial and continual basis, shall be considered
        to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or
        cancellation of the domain name. Failure by you, for whatever reason, to respond
        within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by Azure to determine
        the validity of information provided by you, shall also be considered to be
        a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation
        of the domain name. You agree to retain a copy for your record of the receipt
        for purchase of your domain name.</p>\\n      <p><p>You agree that for each

        information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that
        arise in connection with the Registered Name. A Registered Name Holder licensing
        use of a Registered Name according to this provision shall accept liability
        for harm caused by wrongful use of the Registered Name, unless it disclosers
        the current contact information provided by the licensee and the identity

        Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</a> online. You agree that Azure may
        from time to time modify its Dispute Resolution Policy. Azure will post any
        changes to its Dispute Resolution Policy at least thirty (30) days before
        they become effective. You agree that by maintaining your domain name registrations
        with Azure after the updated policy becomes effective that you agree to the
        Dispute Resolution policy as amended. You agree to review Azure's website
        periodically to determine if changes have been made to the Dispute Resolution
        Policy. If you cancel or terminate your Services with Azure as a result of
        the modified Dispute Resolution policy, no fees will be refunded to you. You
        also agree to submit to proceedings commenced under ICANN's Uniform Rapid
        Suspension System, if applicable. </p>\\n      <p>You agree that if a dispute
        arises as a result of one (1) or more domain names you have registered using
        Azure, you will indemnify, defend and hold Azure harmless as provided for
        in this Agreement. You also agree that if Azure is notified that a complaint
        has been filed with a governmental, administrative or judicial body, regarding
        a domain name registered by you using Azure, that Azure, in its sole discretion,
        may take whatever action Azure deems necessary regarding further modification,
        assignment of and/or control of the domain name deemed necessary to comply
        with the actions or requirements of the governmental, administrative or judicial
        body until such time as the dispute is settled. In this event you agree to
        hold Azure harmless for any action taken by Azure.</p>\\n      <p>You agree
        to submit, without prejudice to other potentially applicable jurisdictions,
        to the jurisdiction of the courts (1) of your domicile, (2) where registrar
        is located or (3) where the registry operator is located (e.g., China for
        .CN, Columbia for .CO, UK for .EU, etc.).</p>\\n      <p>In the case of .ca
        domain names, you agree that, if your use of the service or the registration
        of a .ca domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to

        Name Transfer Agreement and Change of Registrant Agreement online. In order
        to further protect your domain name, any domain name registered with Azure
        or transferred to Azure shall be placed on lock status, unless an opted-out
        has occurred as defined in our Change of Registrant Agreement or Domain Name
        Proxy Agreement. The domain name must be placed on unlock status in order
        to initiate a transfer of the domain name away from Azure to a new Registrar.
        You may log into your account with Azure at any time after your domain name
        has been successfully transferred to Azure, and change the status to unlock.</p>\\n

        not limited to those relating to privacy, data collection, consumer protection,
        fair lending, debt collection, organic farming, and disclosure of data and
        financial disclosures.  If you collect and maintain sensitive health and financial
        data, you must implement reasonable and appropriate security measures commensurate
        with the offering of those services, as defined by applicable law.  You represent
        that you possess any necessary authorization, charter, license, and/or other
        related credential for participation in the sector associated with the associated
        registry tld string.  You will report any material changes to the validity
        of your authorization, charter, license, and/or other related credential.
        You will indemnify and hold harmless the registrar and registry operator,
        and their directors, officers, employees and agents, from and against any
        and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable
        legal fees and expenses) arising out of or related to the domain name registration.

        later by ICANN;</li>  \\r\\n  \\r\\n<li>Your registration of any domain names

        of either Azure or the registry: (i) to comply with specifications adopted
        by any industry group generally recognized as authoritative with respect to
        the Internet (e.g., RFCs), (ii) to protect the integrity and stability of,
        and correct mistakes made by, any domain name registry or registrar, (iii)
        for the non-payment of fees to registry, (iv) to protect the integrity and
        stability of the registry, (v) to comply with any applicable court orders,
        laws, government rules or requirements, requests of law enforcement, or any
        dispute resolution process, (vi) to comply with any applicable ICANN rules
        or regulations, including without limitation, the registry agreement, (vii)
        to avoid any liability, civil or criminal, on the part of registry operator,
        as well as its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, and employees,
        (viii) per the terms of this Agreement, (ix) following an occurrence of any
        of the prohibited activities described in Section 8 below, or (x) during the

        to comply completely with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any
        Azure rule or policy may be considered by Azure to be a material breach of
        this Agreement and Azure may provide you with notice of such breach either
        in writing or electronically (i.e. email). In the event you do not provide
        Azure with material evidence that you have not breached your obligations to
        Azure within ten (10) business days, Azure may terminate its relationship
        with you and take any remedial action available to Azure under the applicable
        laws. Such remedial action may be implemented without notice to you and may
        include, but is not limited to, cancelling the registration of any of your
        domain names and discontinuing any services provided by Azure to you. No fees
        will be refunded to you should your Services be cancelled or terminated because
        of a breach.</p>\\n<p>Azure's failure to act upon or notify you of any event,
        which may constitute a breach, shall not relieve you from or excuse you of
        the fact that you have committed a breach.</p>\\n</p>\\n        <strong><strong>9.
        RESTRICTION OF SERVICES; RIGHT OF REFUSAL</strong></strong>\\n\\n      <p>If
        you are hosting your domain name system (\u201C<u>DNS</u>\u201D) on Azure\u2019s
        servers, or are using our systems to forward a domain name, URL, or otherwise
        to a system or site hosted elsewhere, or if you have your domain name registered
        with Azure, you are responsible for ensuring there is no excessive overloading
        on Azure\u2019s servers. You may not use Azure\u2019s servers and your domain
        name as a source, intermediary, reply to address, or destination address for
        mail bombs, Internet packet flooding, packet corruption, or other abusive
        attack. Server hacking or other perpetration of security breaches is prohibited.
        You agree that Azure reserves the right to deactivate your domain name from
        its DNS if Azure deems it is the recipient of activities caused by your site
        that threaten the stability of its network.</p>\\n      <p><p>You agree that
        Azure, in its sole discretion and without liability to you, may refuse to
        accept the registration of any domain name. Azure also may in its sole discretion
        and without liability to you delete the registration of any domain name during
        the first thirty (30) days after registration has taken place.</p>\\n<p>In
        the event Azure refuses a registration or deletes an existing registration
        during the first thirty (30) days after registration, you will receive a refund
        of any fees paid to Azure in connection with the registration either being
        cancelled or refused. In the event Azure deletes the registration of a domain
        name being used in association with spam or morally objectionable activities,
        no refund will be issued.</p>\\n</p>\\n        <strong><strong>10. DEFAULT
        SETTINGS; PARKED PAGE</strong></strong>\\n\\n      <p><u>Choosing Your Domain
        Name Settings.</u>  When you register a domain name with Azure, you will be
        prompted to choose your domain name settings during the checkout process.
        \ If you plan on using another provider for your website or hosting needs,
        then you should enter the name servers of such provider when you choose your
        domain name settings.  This will direct your domain name away from Azure\u2019s
        name servers.  If you are an existing Azure customer and have already set
        up a customer profile designating your domain name settings for new domain
        name registrations, you will not need to complete this step again during the
        checkout process.   </p>\\n      <p><u>Azure\u2019s Default Settings.</u>
        \ If you do not direct your domain name away from Azure\u2019s name servers
        as described above, Azure will direct your domain name to a \u201C<u>Parked
        Page</u>\u201D (\u201C<u>Default Setting</u>\u201D).  You acknowledge and
        agree that Azure has the right to set the Default Setting. </p>\\n      <p><u>Parked
        Page Default Setting.</u>  Azure's Parked Page service is an online domain
        monetization system designed to generate revenue (through the use of pay per
        click advertising) from domain names that are not actively being used as websites.
        \ If your domain name is directed to a Parked Page, you acknowledge and agree
        that Azure may display both (a) in-house advertising (which includes links
        to Azure products and services) and (b) third-party advertising (which includes
        links to third-party products and services) on your Parked Page through the
        use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or
        video streams, or any other advertising means, and we may aggregate for our
        own use, related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means.  In
        addition, you acknowledge and agree that all in-house and third-party advertising
        will be selected by Azure and its advertising partners, as appropriate, and
        you will not be permitted to customize the advertising, or entitled to any
        compensation in exchange therefor.  Please note that the third-party advertising
        displayed on Azure\u2019s Parked Pages may contain content offensive to you,
        including but not limited to links to adult content.  Azure  makes no effort
        to edit, control, monitor, or restrict the content and third-party advertising
        displayed on Azure\u2019s Parked Pages, and expressly disclaims any liability
        or responsibility to you or any third party in connection therewith.</p>\\n

        In Domain Name Monetization.</u>  If you wish to participate in the domain

        you.</li></ol></p>\\n      <p><u>Return To Parked Page Default Setting Upon
        Domain Name Expiration.</u>  Upon domain name expiration, and regardless of
        how you use your domain name during the term of your domain name registration,
        your domain name will automatically return to the Parked Page Default Setting
        described above.  As used in this paragraph, \u201Cexpiration\u201D is deemed
        to include any \u201Crenewal period\u201D or \u201Credemption period\u201D
        immediately after the domain name expires, but before the domain name is returned
        to the registry.  Once your domain name has returned to the Parked Page Default
        Setting described above, the only way to opt out of the Parked Page service
        is to renew, redeem, or re-register your domain name in accordance with Section
        2(B), Domain Name Renewal Terms, of this Agreement.</p>\\n        <strong><strong>11.

        The service may not be used to consolidate domains that are on Registrar HOLD,
        Registry HOLD, or pending Transfer status. You acknowledge the service may
        only be used to push the expiration date of Your domains forward in time,
        at least one (1) month forward and no more than ten (10) years forward, and
        then, only for a period lasting less than twelve (12) months. Once the service
        has been used to consolidate domains, the new expiration date may not be reversed.
        To ensure the service is not abused or used as an alternative to renewals,
        you may only use the service on each domain once in any 12-month period. The
        service may only be used on domain names that have not passed their expiration
        date. In order to change the expiration date again, You will be required to
        renew the domain name first.  You further understand and acknowledge the service
        may only be used to coordinate domains where we are the registrar of record.
        Domains not registered with us must be transferred before we can perform the

        name that has expired shall be subject first to a grace period of twelve (12)
        days, followed by the ICANN-mandated redemption grace period of thirty (30)
        days. During this period of time, the current domain name registrant may renew
        the domain name and retain registration rights. We do not guarantee your backorder
        will result in you obtaining the domain name and expressly reserves the right
        to (a) refuse additional backorders or (b) cancel existing backorders at any
        time for any reason.  If your backorder is refused or cancelled, we agree
        to promptly refund any fees paid for such domain name backorder. The domain
        name may also be placed in a secondary market for resale through the Auctions\xAE
        service.  After your first year of Auctions membership, you agree that unless
        otherwise advised, we will automatically renew your Auctions membership using
        the payment method you have on file for so long as your backorder credit is
        active. You may learn more about Auctions by visiting the Auctions website.
        The domain name may also be subject to a drop pool process before it is available
        for purchasing. You understand we and our registrar affiliates use our services,
        including backordering.  Therefore, the domain name may be registered with

        domain name, you will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Domain
        Name Registration and related agreements, which are incorporated herein by
        reference.</li><li>Change your backorder until you obtain a domain name. You
        will have the opportunity to change the credit to a different domain name

        from all and any claims or liabilities, arising from, as a result of, or otherwise

        Agreement. <br />\\n<br />\\n<u><em>CIRA Certified Registrar</em></u>.  The
        registrar shall immediately give notice to you in the event that it is no
        longer a CIRA Certified Registrar, has had its certification as a CIRA Certified
        Registrar suspended or terminated, or the Registrar Agreement between CIRA
        and the Registrar is terminated or expires. CIRA may post notice of such suspension,
        termination, or expiry on its website and may, if CIRA deems appropriate,
        give notice to the registrants thereof. In the event that the registrar is
        no longer a CIRA Certified Registrar, has had its certification as a CIRA
        Certified Registrar suspended or terminated or in the event the Registrar
        Agreement between CIRA and the Registrar is terminated or expires, you shall
        be responsible for changing your Registrar of Record to a new CIRA Certified
        Registrar within thirty (30) days of the earlier of notice thereof being given
        to you by (i) the Registrar or (ii) CIRA in accordance with CIRA's then current
        Registry PRP; provided, however, that if any of your domain name registrations
        are scheduled to expire within thirty (30) days of the giving of such notice,
        then you shall have thirty (30) days from the anniversary date of the registration(s),
        to register with a new CIRA certified registrar and to renew such domain name
        registration(s) in accordance with the Registry PRP.<br />\\n<br />\\nYou

        CIRA may in its sole discretion stop accepting applications for domain name
        registrations from the registrar, stop effecting registrations of domain names
        and transfers, renewals, modifications, and cancellations requested by the
        registrar and stop performing other billable transactions requested by the
        registrar not paid in full and CIRA may terminate the Registrar Agreement
        between CIRA and the Registrar.<br />\\n<br />\\n<u><em>.CA ASCII and IDN
        domain variants</em></u> are bundled and reserved for a single registrant.
        \ Registrants are not required to register all variants in a bundle, but all
        registered variants must be registered and managed at a single registrar.
        Each variant registered will incur a registration fee.  In addition, when
        registering multiple .CA domain (ASCII and IDN) variants in a bundle, your
        registrant information <strong><em>must be identical</em></strong>.  If variants
        are registered at other registrars or if registrant information does not match,
        it may result in an &quot;unavailable&quot; search result, delayed or failed
        registration. If information does not match, validation is required and may
        take up to seven business days and delay availability of domain.</p>\\n</p>\\n

        name check <strong><em>and</em></strong> real name verification as required
        by the People\u2019s Republic of China.  Registrations in .CN are therefore
        subject to the following additional terms:</p>\\n<p><u><em>Verification, Registration
        and Activation</em></u>.  If a domain name is not permitted to be registered
        by the Chinese government, as determined by us, the Registry Operator and/or
        a 3rd party provider utilized for such services and determinations, in either
        party\u2019s discretion, the application for registration will not be successful.
        \ In such event, the name will be deleted and you will be eligible for a refund
        as further described below.</p>\\n<p>If permitted, then the Registration may
        proceed, but a .CN domain name may not be activated (i.e., it will not resolve
        in the Internet) <u><em>unless and until</em></u> you have submitted (via
        the process described during registration) valid documents required of us
        and the Registry to perform real name verification.  The following are acceptable
        forms of documents for the purpose of verification:\\r\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>China:
        Resident ID, temporary resident ID, business license or organization code
        certificate</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>Hong Kong/Macau: Resident ID, driver\u2019s

        us are used by us and shared with the Registry solely for the purpose of real
        name verification, and are otherwise subject to our <a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/privacy-policy?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Privacy
        Policy</a>.  By registering a .CN domain, you expressly agree that your data
        may be stored on servers in the U.S., or otherwise outside of the People's
        Republic of China.</p>\\n<p><u><em>Refunds</em></u>.  Refunds for .CN Registrations
        will only be allowed where (i) registration of the applied for domain name
        is not permitted by the Chinese government; or (ii) you notify us of your
        intent to cancel for any reason within the first five (5) days after the Registration
        (i.e., after it is deemed permissible by the Chinese government).  For the
        avoidance of doubt, refunds will not be permitted under any circumstances
        after five (5) days from the date of Registration, including, for example,
        in the event real name verification is not successful or if the Chinese government
        determines after Registration that the domain name should not have been registered
        (and directs us to delete).</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong><em>(D) PROVISIONS
        SPECIFIC TO .JP REGISTRATIONS</em></strong>  <br />\\n<u><em>Registration
        Restrictions</em></u>.  You represent and warrant that you have a local presence
        in Japan with a home or office address. You agree that certain domain names
        are reserved and can only be registered by certain parties. These include:
        (i) TLDs, other than ccTLDs, as determined by ICANN; (ii) geographical-type
        .JP domain names that are defined as metropolitan, prefectural, and municipal
        labels; (iii) names of primary and secondary educational organizations; (iv)
        names of organizations related to Internet management; (v) names required
        for .JP domain name operations; and (vi) character strings which may be confused
        with ASCII-converted Japanese domain names. The complete list of .JP Reserved
        Domains is available <a href=\\\"https://www.nic.ad.jp/dotjp/doc/dotjp-reserved.html\\\">here</a>.

        OWN</strong></strong>\\n\\n      <p><p>The following additional Terms apply
        with respect to Lease to Own Services (the \u201CLTO Services\u201D) provided
        by Azure, to you.</p>\\n<p><strong>(A) Definitions:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>LTO
        Domain</strong>: a domain name that you purchase from Azure through the Site
        with an agreement to pay over time.</li>\\n<li><strong>LTO Term</strong>:
        the period agreed between Azure and Buyer during which Buyer will have access
        to the DNS and will make monthly payments to Azure.</li>\\n<li><strong>Service
        Fee</strong>: fee owed by Buyer to Azure for the Services provided by Azure
        during the LTO Term, including, but not limited to, renewing the LTO Domain,
        providing administrative services related to the management of the LTO Domain,
        forwarding correspondence, etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(B)
        Description of Services.</strong> </p>\\n<p>The LTO Services are provided
        to facilitate the buying and selling of currently registered domain names
        through payments over time, and not the purchase or sale of associated website
        content.</p>\\n<p>As Buyer, you agree to purchase the LTO Domain from Azure.
        During the LTO Term, Azure will make the DNS for the LTO Domain available
        to Buyer. You are required to deposit the mutually agreed-upon price and Buyer\u2019s
        Service Fee, as established by Azure, as soon as practical after you agree
        to the purchase price, but in no event later than five (5) business days.
        At no time will Buyer be able to withdraw those funds or send the funds to
        another recipient unless the initial transaction is cancelled. You agree that
        Azure is not responsible for breach of contract based upon a failure to transfer
        the LTO Domain to Buyer after the first payment is deposited. In the event
        that Azure is unable to make the LTO Domain Name DNS available to Buyer after
        the first installment payment, Azure shall return any funds provided by buyer
        for the purchase of the LTO Domain Name as soon as commercially reasonably
        possible.</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(C) Fees and Payment.</strong></p>\\n<p>You
        are responsible for paying the monthly payment related to your LTO Domain
        plus any applicable Service Fee.</p>\\n<p>Any commissions may be subtracted
        from the payment, instalment payment or rental payment and, if these payments
        are not sufficient, from the subsequent payments. In the event that the domain
        name is purchased in instalments or rented, the commission subtracted will
        be limited to the secured instalment or rent payment (e.g.: if the commission
        is 25%, and the instalment price $100, the Azure only subtracts $25 from the
        payout of the Seller for each instalment.)</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(D)
        Your Additional Obligations.</strong></p>\\n<ol><li>Buyer agrees to use the
        LTO Domain only in accordance with any applicable laws and/or regulations,
        and with all duty and care. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer is prohibited
        from using the LTO Domain in a manner (as determined by Azure in its sole
        and absolute discretion) that:<ol type=a><li>in breach of any applicable law,
        statute, or regulation;</li><li>is fraudulent, criminal or unlawful;</li><li>promotes
        racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or
        individual;</li><li>infringes or breaches the patent, copyright, trademark,
        trade secret, right of publicity or other intellectual property) rights of
        any third party;</li><li>contains video, audio photographs, or images of another
        person without his or her permission (or in the case of a minor, the minor's
        legal guardian\u2019s permission);</li><li>provides information on any illegal
        activity (including, but not limited to, instructional information on acquiring
        or fabricating illegal weapons or drugs, privacy violations or distributing
        computer viruses);</li><li>publicizes or promotes commercial activities an/or
        sales without our prior written consent such as contests, sweepstakes, barter,
        advertising, and pyramid schemes; or</li><li>involves the use, delivery or
        transmission of any viruses, harmful code, unsolicited emails, Trojan horses
        or any other computer programming routines that are intended to disrupt, damage,
        detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any
        system, data or personal information.</li></ol></li><li>Buyer acknowledges
        and agrees not to engage in any activity with the LTO Domain or using the
        LTO Services that would decrease the value of the LTO Domain. Such activities
        include, but are not limited to, the use of aggressive SEO strategies, techniques
        and tactics that focus only on search engines and not a human audience, and
        usually does not obey search engines guidelines (black hat SEO), such as keyword
        stuffing, invisible text, doorway pages, adding unrelated keywords to the
        page content or page swapping (changing the webpage entirely after it has
        been ranked by search engines), and the use of the domain name for spam activities.</li><li>Buyer
        may not grant any third party any rights to the LTO Domain, including any
        right to use the LTO Domain.</li><li>\\tBuyer agrees to protect, defend, indemnity
        and hold harmless Azure and its officers, directors, employees, agents and
        third party service providers from and against any and all claims, demands,
        costs, expenses, losses liabilities and damages of every kind and nature (including,
        without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) imposed upon or incurred
        by Azure directly or indirectly arising from (i) your use of the LTO Services;
        (ii) your violation(s) of any provision of this Agreement; and/or (iii) your
        violation of any third party right, including without limitation any intellectual
        property or other proprietary right. This indemnification obligation shall
        survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or your use of the
        LTO Services.</li></ol>\\r\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>E. Azure\u2019s Rights.</strong></p>\\n<ol><li>Azure
        may terminate your use of the LTO Services for any violation or breach of
        any of the terms of this Agreement by you. Any such termination will not entitle
        you to any refund of payments already made to Azure for any LTO Services or
        Service Fee, and you will lose any and all access to the applicable LTO Domain.</li><li>If
        the LTO Services are terminated, Azure reserves the right to sell the LTO
        Domain to any party, including potential competitors of Buyer. Azure shall
        have no ongoing obligation to Buyer related to the LTO Domain.</li><li>The
        parties acknowledge and agree that the Azure is not a payment provider and
        that Azure does not make any warranties in that respect. In order to effectuate
        the transfer of payments, Azure uses the services of a third party payment
        provider. The terms and conditions of the third party payment provider shall
        apply to such payments.</li></ol>\\r\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>F. Remedies
        and Right to Cancel.</strong></p>\\n<p>Without limiting any other remedies
        available to Azure, if:</p>\\n<ol type=A><li>You breach this Agreement, or
        any document incorporated by reference;</li><li>Azure determines your actions
        may pose a risk to Azure or its members;</li><li>Azure determines your use
        of the Services infringes on the intellectual property or legal rights of
        others.</li></ol>\\r\\n<p>Azure may immediately:</p>\\n<ol type=i><li>Warn
        its members of your actions;</li><li>Place a hold on any pending transactions
        associated with your account(s);</li><li>Limit funding sources and payments;</li><li>Limit
        your access to your account(s) or to any functionality of your account(s);
        or</li><li>Indefinitely suspend or close your account(s) and refuse to provide
        our Services to you.</li></ol><p></li></ol></p>\\n<p>In addition, Azure reserves
        the right to hold funds beyond normal distribution periods for transactions
        it deems suspicious or for account(s) conducting high transaction volumes
        to ensure integrity of the funds. If Azure closes your account(s), Azure will
        provide notice and pay you all of the unrestricted funds in your account(s)
        due to you.</p>\\n</p>\\n</div>\\n\",\"url\":\"http://www.secureserver.net/agreements/ShowDoc.aspx?pageid=reg_sa&pl_id=510456\"},{\"agreementKey\":\"DNPA\",\"title\":\"Domains

        Correspondence Forwarding</strong>  \\r</p>\\n<p>Inasmuch as Azure's name,
        postal address and phone number will be listed in the Whois directory, You
        agree Azure will review and forward communications addressed to Your domain
        name that are received via email, certified or traceable courier mail (such
        as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or first class U.S. postal mail. You specifically
        acknowledge Azure will not forward to You first class postal mail (other than
        legal notices), &quot;junk&quot; mail or other unsolicited communications
        (whether delivered through email, fax, postal mail or telephone), and You
        further authorize Azure to either discard all such communications or return
        all such communications to sender unopened. You agree to waive any and all
        claims arising from Your failure to receive communications directed to Your
        domain name but not forwarded to You by Azure. <br />\\n</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>b.
        Email Forwarding</strong><br />\\n<br />\\nThe Whois directory requires an
        email address for every purchased domain name registration. When You purchase
        a private domain registration, Azure creates a private email address for that
        domain name, &quot;@domainsbyproxy.com&quot;. Thereafter, when messages are
        sent to that private email address, Azure handles them according to the email
        preference You selected for that particular domain name. You have three (3)
        email preferences from which to choose. You can elect to:<br />\\n</p>\\n<ol
        type=i><li>Have all of the messages forwarded;</li><li> Have all of the messages
        filtered for Spam and then forwarded; or</li><li>Have none of the messages
        forwarded.</li></ol>\\r\\n<p><br />\\nAs with all communications, You agree
        to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive email directed
        to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by Azure.</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>c.
        Notifications Regarding Correspondence and Your Obligation to Respond</strong></p>\\n<p>When
        Azure receives certified or traceable courier mail or legal notices addressed
        to Your domain name, in most cases, Azure will attempt to forward the mail
        to you via email. If You do not respond to the Azure email and/or the correspondence
        Azure has received regarding Your domain name registration concerns a dispute
        of any kind or otherwise requires immediate disposition, Azure may immediately
        reveal Your identity and/or cancel the Azure private registration service
        regarding either the domain name registration(s) in question. This means the
        Whois directory will revert to displaying Your name, postal address, email
        address and phone number that you provided to Azure.  </p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>d.

        right to charge You reasonable &quot;administrative fees&quot; or &quot;processing
        fees&quot; for (i)  tasks Azure may perform outside the normal scope of its
        Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs Azure may incur in providing its
        Services, and/or (iii) Your non-compliance with the Agreement (as determined
        by Azure in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing
        fee scenarios include, but are not limited to, (i) customer service issues
        that require additional personal time and attention; (ii) disputes that require
        accounting or legal services, whether performed by Azure staff or by outside
        firms retained by Azure; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including
        the cost of DBP Services, incurred by Azure as the result of chargebacks or
        other payment disputes brought by You, Your bank or Payment Method processor.
        \ These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment
        Method You have on file with Your Registrar.</p>\\n<p>You agree to waive the

        Your domain name registration to a third party solely as a result of Azure's
        willful misconduct, Your Registrar (the &quot;Indemnifying Party&quot;) will
        indemnify and hold You harmless against any losses, damages or costs (including
        reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any claim, action, proceeding,
        suit or demand arising out of or related to the loss of Your domain name registration.
        Such indemnification obligations under this Section 10(e) are conditioned
        upon the following:<ol type=i><li>That You promptly give both Azure and the
        Indemnifying Party written notice of the claim, demand, or action and provide
        reasonable assistance to the Indemnifying Party, at its cost and expense,
        in connection therewith, and</li><li>That the Indemnifying Party has the right,
        at its option, to control and direct the defense to any settlement of such
        claim, demand, or action.</li></ol>  \\r</p>\\n<p>Any notice concerning indemnification
        shall, with respect to Azure, be sent in accordance with Section 10(c) of
        this Agreement. With respect to Your Registrar, notices regarding indemnification
        should be sent in accordance with the notification provisions contained in
        Your Registrar's Domain Name Registration Agreement.  </p>\\n</p>\\n</div>\\n\",\"url\":\"http://www.secureserver.net/agreements/ShowDoc.aspx?pageid=domain_nameproxy&pl_id=510456\"}],\"nextLink\":null,\"id\":null}"
