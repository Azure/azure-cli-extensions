        Domain Name Registration Agreement (this &quot;<u>Agreement</u>&quot;) is
        entered into by and between Microsoft Azure (&quot;Azure&quot;) and you, and
        is made effective as of the date of electronic acceptance.  This Agreement
        sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of Azure's Domain Name Registration
        services (the &quot;<u>Domain Name Registration Services</u>&quot; or the
        &quot;<u>Services</u>&quot;). The terms &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or
        &quot;our&quot; shall refer to Azure.  The terms &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;,
        &quot;User&quot; or &quot;customer&quot; shall refer to any individual or
        entity who accepts this Agreement.  Unless otherwise specified, nothing in
        this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</p>\\n
        \     <p>Your electronic acceptance of this Agreement signifies that you have
        read, understand, acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Agreement, which
        incorporates by reference each of (i) Azure\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/universal-terms-of-service-agreement?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Universal

        discretion, may change or modify this Agreement, and any policies or agreements
        which are incorporated herein, at any time, and such changes or modifications
        shall be effective immediately upon posting to this Site, and (ii) your use

        your shopper account (\u201C<u>Shopper Account</u>\u201D) information, including
        your email address, current.  Azure assumes no liability or responsibility
        for your failure to receive an email notification if such failure results

        for Assigned Names and Numbers (&quot;<u>ICANN</u>&quot;) accredited registrar.
        \ \\r</p>\\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that Azure may modify this Agreement
        in order to comply with any terms and conditions set forth by (i) ICANN and/or
        (ii) the registry applicable to the TLD or country code top level domain (&quot;<u>ccTLD</u>&quot;)
        in question. The term \u201CRegistry Service Provider\u201D shall refer to
        the service provider responsible for operating and managing the registry services

        \       <strong><strong>2. PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO ALL REGISTRATIONS</strong>
        \ </strong>\\n\\n      <p><p><em>Unless otherwise noted, the provisions below
        in this Section 2 are generally applicable to all TLDs that we offer.  Special
        provisions specific to any TLD or ccTLD (those in addition to posted Registry
        Policies) are identified elsewhere below in this Agreement.</em>  \\r</p>\\n<p><ol><li><em><u>Registry
        Policies.</u></em> You agree to be bound by all Registry Policies (defined
        above in this Agreement) applicable to your domain name registration (at any
        level). IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO VISIT THE APPLICABLE TLD SITE AND READ
        AND REVIEW ALL APPLICABLE REGISTRY POLICIES PRIOR TO YOUR REGISTRATION IN
        THE TLD.  REGISTRY POLICIES FOR EACH TLD CAN BE FOUND BY VISITING THE CORRESPONDING
        TLD LINK LISTED<a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/tld-registry-policies?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">HERE</a>.
        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Registry Operator
        of the TLD in which the domain name registration is made is and shall be an
        intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement. As such the parties to
        this agreement acknowledge and agree that the third party beneficiary rights
        of the Registry Operator have vested and that the Registry Operator has relied
        on its third party beneficiary rights under this Agreement in agreeing to
        Azure being a registrar for the respective TLD. The third party beneficiary
        rights of the Registry Operator will survive any termination of this Agreement.</li>
        \ </p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Registration Requirements.</u></em> To
        the extent any TLD or ccTLD requires you meet eligibility (e.g., residency
        for .JP, .EU, etc.), validation (e.g., DNS validation) or other authentication
        requirements as a condition to registering a domain name in the TLD, you agree
        that by submitting an application or registering or renewing your domain name,
        you represent and warrant that: (a) all information provided to register or
        renew the domain name (including all supporting documents, if any) is true,
        complete and correct, and is not misleading in any way, and the application
        is made in good faith; (b) you meet, and will continue to meet, the eligibility
        criteria prescribed in the Registry Policies for the applicable TLD for the
        duration of the domain name registration; (c) you have not previously submitted
        an application for the domain name with another registrar using the same eligibility
        criteria, and the other registrar has rejected the application (if applicable);
        (d) you acknowledge and agree that even if the domain name is accepted for
        registration, your entitlement to register the domain name may be challenged
        by others who claim to have an entitlement to the domain name; and (e) you
        acknowledge and agree that the Registry or the registrar can cancel the registration
        of the domain name if any of the warranties required are found to be untrue,
        incomplete, incorrect or misleading.</li>  </p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Ownership.</u></em>
        You acknowledge and agree that registration of a domain name does not create
        any proprietary right for you, the registrar, or any other person in the name
        used as a domain name or the domain name registration and that the entry of
        a domain name in the Registry shall not be construed as evidence or ownership
        of the domain name registered as a domain name. You shall not in any way transfer
        or purport to transfer a proprietary right in any domain name registration
        or grant or purport to grant as security or in any other manner encumber or
        purport to encumber a domain name registration.</li>  \\r</p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>ICANN
        Requirements.</u></em> You agree to comply with the ICANN requirements, standards,
        policies, procedures, and practices for which each applicable Registry Operator
        has monitoring responsibility in accordance with the Registry Agreement between
        ICANN and itself or any other arrangement with ICANN. For additional ICANN-related
        helpful information, please see <a href=\\\"https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/educational-2012-02-25-en\\\">ICANN

        Benefits and Responsibilities</a>.</li>  \\r</p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Indemnification
        of Registry.</u></em>  You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (within
        30 days of demand) the Registry Operator and Registry Service Provider and
        their subcontractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, divisions, shareholders, directors,
        officers, employees, accountants, attorneys, insurers, agents, predecessors,
        successors and assigns, from and against any and all claims, demands, damages,
        losses, costs, expenses, causes of action or other liabilities of any kind,
        whether known or unknown, including reasonable legal and attorney\u2019s fees
        and expenses, in any way arising out of, relating to, or otherwise in connection
        with the your domain name registration, including, without limitation, the
        use, registration, extension, renewal, deletion, and/or transfer thereof and/or
        the violation of any applicable terms or conditions governing the registration.
        You shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any such indemnifiable
        claim without Registrar\u2019s or Registry Operator\u2019s prior written consent,
        which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and you agree that these
        indemnification obligations shall survive the termination or expiration of
        the Agreement for any reason.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE REGISTRY OPERATOR BE
        LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
        SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFIT OR GOODWILL,
        FOR ANY MATTER, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS ASSERTED ON THE BASIS OF CONTRACT,

        ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS INCORPORATED AGREEMENTS AND POLICIES YOUR
        INABILITY TO USE THE DOMAIN NAME, YOUR LOSS OF DATA OR FILES OR OTHERWISE,
        EVEN IF THE REGISTRY OPERATOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.</li>  \\r</p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Regulated TLDs.</u></em> For
        domain name registration in any \u201CRegulated\u201D TLD, you acknowledge
        and agree your registration is subject to the following additional requirements:

        data collection, consumer protection (including in relation to misleading
        and deceptive conduct), fair lending, debt collection, organic farming, disclosure
        of data, and financial disclosures; (b) if you collect and maintain sensitive
        health and financial data you must implement reasonable and appropriate security
        measures commensurate with the offering of those services, as defined by applicable
        law.  Regulated TLDs include: <em>.games, .juegos, .school, .schule, .toys,
        .eco, .care, .diet, .fitness, .health, .clinic, .dental, .healthcare, .capital,

        TLDs.</u></em> In addition to the requirements for Regulated TLDs, domain
        name registration in any Highly-Regulated TLD is subject to the following
        requirements: (a) you will provide administrative contact information, which
        must be kept up\u2010to\u2010date, for the notification of complaints or reports
        of registration abuse, as well as the contact details of the relevant regulatory,
        or Industry self\u2010regulatory, bodies in their main place of business;
        (b) you represent that you possess any necessary authorizations, charters,
        licenses and/or other related credentials for participation in the sector
        associated with such Highly\u2010regulated TLD; and (c) you will report any
        material changes to the validity of you authorizations, charters, licenses
        and/or other related credentials for participation in the sector associated
        with the Highly\u2010regulated TLD to ensure you continue to conform to the
        appropriate regulations and licensing requirements and generally conduct your
        activities in the interests of the consumers they serve.  Highly Regulated
        TLDs include: _.abogado, .attorney, .bank, .bet, .bingo, .casino .charity

        hold themselves out to be licensed medical practitioners must be able to demonstrate
        to the Registrar and Registry, upon request, that they hold the applicable
        license.</li>  </p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Special Safeguard TLDs.</u></em>
        In addition to the requirements for Regulated and Highly-Regulated TLDs, by
        registering a domain name in any \u201CSpecial-Safeguard\u201D TLD, you agree
        to take reasonable steps to avoid misrepresenting or falsely implying that
        you or your business is affiliated with, sponsored or endorsed by one or more
        country's or government's military forces if such affiliation, sponsorship
        or endorsement does not exist.  Special Safeguard TLDs include:  <em>.army,
        .navy, .airforce</em></li></p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Third Party Beneficiary.</u></em>
        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Registry Operator
        for any TLD in which your register a domain name is and shall be an intended
        third party beneficiary of this Agreement. As such the parties to this agreement
        acknowledge and agree that the third party beneficiary rights of the Registry
        Operator have vested and that the Registry Operator has relied on its third
        party beneficiary rights under this Agreement in agreeing to Azure being a
        registrar for the TLD. Third party beneficiary rights of the Registry Operator
        shall survive any termination of this Agreement.</li>  \\r</p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Variable
        and Non-Uniform Pricing.</u></em> You acknowledge, understand and agree that
        certain domain names in certain TLDs are established by Registry Policies
        to be variably priced (i.e., standard v. premium names) and/or may have non-uniform
        renewal registration pricing (such that the Fee for a domain name registration
        renewal may differ from other domain names in the same TLD, e.g., renewal
        registration for one domain may be $100.00 and $33.00 for a different domain
        name).</li>  \\r</p>\\n        <strong></ol><strong>3. FEES AND PAYMENTS</strong></strong>\\n\\n
        \     <p><p><strong>(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS</strong></p>\\n<p>You
        agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained
        at this Site at the time you order the Services.  Azure expressly reserves
        the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes
        or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately
        without need for further notice to you.  If you have purchased or obtained
        Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices
        and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal
        as further described below.   \\r</p>\\n<p>Unless otherwise specifically noted
        (for reasons such as those highlighted in Section 2(x) above), the renewal
        price for any domain name in any TLD will be the same as the list (non-sale)
        price shown when you search for and select a domain, and again in the cart
        prior to purchase.  For example, if the list price is $9.99, and a different
        renewal price is not specifically identified, then the renewal price is also
        $9.99.  Likewise, if a domain name has a sale price of $8.99, with the list
        (non-sale) price shown (as a strike-through) at $9.99, the renewal price will
        be $9.99*.  \\r</p>\\n<p><small>* Renewal price subject to change prior to
        actual date of renewal.</small>  \\r</p>\\n<p>For all other terms and conditions
        relating to fees, payment, refund and billing, etc. applicable to the Services
        offered under the scope of this Agreement, please refer to the \u201CFees
        and Payments\u201D section of our <a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/universal-terms-of-service-agreement?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Universal
        Terms of Service</a>.   \\r</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(B) DOMAIN NAME
        RENEWAL TERMS</strong></p>\\n<p>When you register a domain name, you will
        have the following renewal options: </p>\\n<p><ol><li><em>Automatic Renewal.</em>
        Automatic Renewal is the default setting. Domain names will automatically
        renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name
        registration, and payment will be taken from the Payment Method you have on
        file with Azure, at Azure's then current rates. Thus, if you have chosen to
        register your domain name for one (1) year, Azure will automatically renew
        it for one (1) year. If you have chosen to register your domain name for two

        If you wish to change your automatic renewal term to a different period from
        your original term,  as of 16 July 2020, you may manually renew the domain
        registration to establish a new default automatic renewal term for the domain.</li></p>\\n</p>\\n
        \     <p><li><em>Manual Renewal.</em>  If you have elected to turn off automatic
        renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel the domain name registration)
        effective at expiration of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect
        to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its expiration date
        by logging into your <a href=\\\"https://account.secureserver.net?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Account
        Manager</a> and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service
        (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed). If you fail to manually
        implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be
        cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</li></ol> </p>\\n
        \     <p>All renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it
        may be amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound
        by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.  Domain
        name renewals will be non-refundable. In the event that we are unable to automatically
        renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we
        may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than your original
        registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.
        If for any reason Azure is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method
        you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name
        registration will expire. It is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method

        cancelled, no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date,
        or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status. For some ccTLDs
        (.es) renewal must be processed no later than seven days before the expiration
        date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.  When the
        domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by
        calling Azure and requesting that the domain name be renewed. You cannot renew
        the domain name through your <a href=\\\"https://account.secureserver.net?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Account

        apply. If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any
        other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services
        will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for
        renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you
        cancel in advance. </p>\\n      <p><p>If you fail to renew your domain name
        in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that Azure may, in
        its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf. If Azure

        after the expiration date of the domain name. If you do not reimburse Azure
        for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed
        on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption
        period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject
        to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay Azure a Redemption fee.
        </p>\\n<p>The Redemption fee is displayed at checkout and is subject to change
        under the terms of this Agreement. If you do not redeem your domain name prior
        to the end of the 30-day redemption period Azure may, in its sole discretion,
        delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.
        \ During the redemption period your domain name may be parked.</p>\\n</p>\\n

        five (5) days after registration.  In the event a free domain name is offered
        with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered
        fails, then we may, in our sole discretion, either delete the registration
        of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the
        value of the free domain.  Failed registrations associated with promotional

        domain name registered through Azure.  \\r</p>\\n      <p>You agree that you
        will not transfer any domain name registered through Azure to another domain
        name registrar during the first sixty (60) days after its initial registration
        date.  You agree that you may not transfer any domain name for ten (10) days
        after a Change of Account.  \\r</p>\\n      <p>You further agree that you
        will not engage in &quot;domain tasting&quot; by using the five (5) day grace
        period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain name and get a
        full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the marketability
        or viability of a domain name.  If Azure determines (which determination shall
        be made by Azure in its sole and absolute discretion) that you have been engaging
        in &quot;domain tasting&quot;, then Azure reserves the right to (a) charge
        you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any refund issued) or (b)
        refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether. Azure will not charge
        you a fee if Azure cancels your domain name during the five (5) day grace
        period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control. The five (5)
        day grace period does not apply to Premium Domains, which are non-refundable.
        \ \\r</p>\\n      <p>You agree that Azure shall not be bound by (i) any representations
        made by third parties who you may use to purchase services from Azure, or
        (ii) any statements of a general nature, which may be posted on Azure's website
        or contained in Azure's promotional materials.</p>\\n        <strong><strong>5.

        and accurate status. Failure by you, for whatever reason, to provide Azure
        with accurate and reliable information on an initial and continual basis,
        shall be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis
        for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name. Failure by you, for
        whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries
        made by Azure to determine the validity of information provided by you, shall
        also be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for

        contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems
        that arise in connection with the Registered Name. A Registered Name Holder
        licensing use of a Registered Name according to this provision shall accept
        liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the Registered Name, unless it
        disclosers the current contact information provided by the licensee and the

        they become effective. You agree that by maintaining your domain name registrations
        with Azure after the updated policy becomes effective that you agree to the

        Policy. If you cancel or terminate your Services with Azure as a result of
        the modified Dispute Resolution policy, no fees will be refunded to you. You

        may take whatever action Azure deems necessary regarding further modification,
        assignment of and/or control of the domain name deemed necessary to comply
        with the actions or requirements of the governmental, administrative or judicial
        body until such time as the dispute is settled. In this event you agree to
        hold Azure harmless for any action taken by Azure.</p>\\n      <p>You agree
        to submit, without prejudice to other potentially applicable jurisdictions,
        to the jurisdiction of the courts (1) of your domicile, (2) where registrar

        has occurred as defined in our Change of Registrant Agreement or Domain Name
        Proxy Agreement. The domain name must be placed on unlock status in order
        to initiate a transfer of the domain name away from Azure to a new Registrar.
        You may log into your account with Azure at any time after your domain name
        has been successfully transferred to Azure, and change the status to unlock.</p>\\n

        and their directors, officers, employees and agents, from and against any
        and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable
        legal fees and expenses) arising out of or related to the domain name registration.

        of either Azure or the registry: (i) to comply with specifications adopted
        by any industry group generally recognized as authoritative with respect to
        the Internet (e.g., RFCs), (ii) to protect the integrity and stability of,
        and correct mistakes made by, any domain name registry or registrar, (iii)

        the event Azure refuses a registration or deletes an existing registration
        during the first thirty (30) days after registration, you will receive a refund
        of any fees paid to Azure in connection with the registration either being
        cancelled or refused. In the event Azure deletes the registration of a domain
        name being used in association with spam or morally objectionable activities,
        no refund will be issued.</p>\\n</p>\\n        <strong><strong>10. DEFAULT

        Name Settings.</u>  When you register a domain name with Azure, you will be
        prompted to choose your domain name settings during the checkout process.
        \ If you plan on using another provider for your website or hosting needs,
        then you should enter the name servers of such provider when you choose your
        domain name settings.  This will direct your domain name away from Azure\u2019s
        name servers.  If you are an existing Azure customer and have already set
        up a customer profile designating your domain name settings for new domain
        name registrations, you will not need to complete this step again during the
        checkout process.   </p>\\n      <p><u>Azure\u2019s Default Settings.</u>

        that Azure may display both (a) in-house advertising (which includes links
        to Azure products and services) and (b) third-party advertising (which includes

        your domain name will automatically return to the Parked Page Default Setting
        described above.  As used in this paragraph, \u201Cexpiration\u201D is deemed

        is provided to facilitate the buying of currently registered domain names
        only, and not the purchase or sale of associated website content.. Azure provides
        a venue and a transaction facilitation process and will take a stated commission
        for each completed transaction. Azure is not an escrow agent. As a result,
        Azure does not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of many of the domain
        names. Domain names listed may be withdrawn at any time by the seller or by
        us.  You acknowledge and agree that your transaction will be handled by Azure's
        \u201CTransaction Assurance\u201D process. By using Azure's \u201CTransaction
        Assurance\u201D process, you authorize Azure to perform tasks on your behalf
        in order to complete the transaction.  In these transactions, Azure acts as
        a transaction facilitator to help you buy and sell domain names. Azure will
        not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes,
        and will not voluntarily make funds available to its creditors in the event
        of bankruptcy or for any other purpose. You acknowledge Azure is not a bank
        and the service is a payment processing service rather than a banking service.
        You further acknowledge Azure is not acting as a trustee, fiduciary or escrow
        with respect to your funds. In all transactions, where the domain name is
        registered to us, domain names purchased through the Service may not be transferred
        away from us to another registrar for a period of sixty (60) days following

        the registration fee will be added to the price to form the purchase price.
        You agree that by completing the transaction, You are responsible for payment
        of the registration fee. We will obtain the funds first by the Payment Method
        You have designated. If there are insufficient funds or invalid credit card
        information, we may obtain the remaining funds by charging any Payment Method
        You have on file.<br><br>Azure will remit payment of the full agreed upon
        purchase price minus any commissions to the Seller after a prescribed period
        of time after receiving funds from the Buyer, except in the event of a dispute
        or where the payment is suspected to be fraudulent, as determined by Azure
        in its sole and absolute discretion. At no time will You be able to withdraw
        those funds or send the funds to another recipient unless the initial transaction
        is canceled. Transfer of Registration Rights. We are not the registrant of

        domain variants</em></u> are bundled and reserved for a single registrant.
        \ Registrants are not required to register all variants in a bundle, but all
        registered variants must be registered and managed at a single registrar.
        Each variant registered will incur a registration fee.  In addition, when
        registering multiple .CA domain (ASCII and IDN) variants in a bundle, your
        registrant information <strong><em>must be identical</em></strong>.  If variants
        are registered at other registrars or if registrant information does not match,
        it may result in an &quot;unavailable&quot; search result, delayed or failed
        registration. If information does not match, validation is required and may

        \     <p><p><strong><em>(C) PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO .CN REGISTRATIONS</em></strong><br
        />\\n.CN is a restricted TLD \u2013 applications are subject to both a domain
        name check <strong><em>and</em></strong> real name verification as required
        by the People\u2019s Republic of China.  Registrations in .CN are therefore
        subject to the following additional terms:</p>\\n<p><u><em>Verification, Registration
        and Activation</em></u>.  If a domain name is not permitted to be registered
        by the Chinese government, as determined by us, the Registry Operator and/or
        a 3rd party provider utilized for such services and determinations, in either
        party\u2019s discretion, the application for registration will not be successful.
        \ In such event, the name will be deleted and you will be eligible for a refund
        as further described below.</p>\\n<p>If permitted, then the Registration may
        proceed, but a .CN domain name may not be activated (i.e., it will not resolve
        in the Internet) <u><em>unless and until</em></u> you have submitted (via
        the process described during registration) valid documents required of us
        and the Registry to perform real name verification.  The following are acceptable
        forms of documents for the purpose of verification:\\r\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>China:
        Resident ID, temporary resident ID, business license or organization code
        certificate</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>Hong Kong/Macau: Resident ID, driver\u2019s
        license, passport or business license</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>Singapore: Driver\u2019s

        ID, driver\u2019s license or business license</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>Other Countries/Regions:
        Driver\u2019s license or passport</li></ul>\\r\\n<p>Documents submitted to
        us are used by us and shared with the Registry solely for the purpose of real
        name verification, and are otherwise subject to our <a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/privacy-policy?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Privacy
        Policy</a>.  By registering a .CN domain, you expressly agree that your data
        may be stored on servers in the U.S., or otherwise outside of the People's
        Republic of China.</p>\\n<p><u><em>Refunds</em></u>.  Refunds for .CN Registrations
        will only be allowed where (i) registration of the applied for domain name
        is not permitted by the Chinese government; or (ii) you notify us of your
        intent to cancel for any reason within the first five (5) days after the Registration
        (i.e., after it is deemed permissible by the Chinese government).  For the
        avoidance of doubt, refunds will not be permitted under any circumstances
        after five (5) days from the date of Registration, including, for example,
        in the event real name verification is not successful or if the Chinese government
        determines after Registration that the domain name should not have been registered
        (and directs us to delete).</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong><em>(D) PROVISIONS
        SPECIFIC TO .JP REGISTRATIONS</em></strong>  <br />\\n<u><em>Registration
        Restrictions</em></u>.  You represent and warrant that you have a local presence
        in Japan with a home or office address. You agree that certain domain names
        are reserved and can only be registered by certain parties. These include:
        (i) TLDs, other than ccTLDs, as determined by ICANN; (ii) geographical-type
        .JP domain names that are defined as metropolitan, prefectural, and municipal
        labels; (iii) names of primary and secondary educational organizations; (iv)
        names of organizations related to Internet management; (v) names required
        for .JP domain name operations; and (vi) character strings which may be confused
        with ASCII-converted Japanese domain names. The complete list of .JP Reserved
        Domains is available <a href=\\\"https://www.nic.ad.jp/dotjp/doc/dotjp-reserved.html\\\">here</a>.
        </p>\\n</p>\\n        <strong><strong>19. PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO LEASE TO
        OWN</strong></strong>\\n\\n      <p><p>The following additional Terms apply
        with respect to Lease to Own Services (the \u201CLTO Services\u201D) provided
        by Azure, to you.</p>\\n<p><strong>(A) Definitions:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>LTO
        Domain</strong>: a domain name that you purchase from Azure through the Site
        with an agreement to pay over time.</li>\\n<li><strong>LTO Term</strong>:
        the period agreed between Azure and Buyer during which Buyer will have access
        to the DNS and will make monthly payments to Azure.</li>\\n<li><strong>Service
        Fee</strong>: fee owed by Buyer to Azure for the Services provided by Azure
        during the LTO Term, including, but not limited to, renewing the LTO Domain,
        providing administrative services related to the management of the LTO Domain,
        forwarding correspondence, etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(B)
        Description of Services.</strong> </p>\\n<p>The LTO Services are provided
        to facilitate the buying and selling of currently registered domain names
        through payments over time, and not the purchase or sale of associated website
        content.</p>\\n<p>As Buyer, you agree to purchase the LTO Domain from Azure.
        During the LTO Term, Azure will make the DNS for the LTO Domain available
        to Buyer. You are required to deposit the mutually agreed-upon price and Buyer\u2019s
        Service Fee, as established by Azure, as soon as practical after you agree
        to the purchase price, but in no event later than five (5) business days.
        At no time will Buyer be able to withdraw those funds or send the funds to
        another recipient unless the initial transaction is cancelled. You agree that
        Azure is not responsible for breach of contract based upon a failure to transfer
        the LTO Domain to Buyer after the first payment is deposited. In the event
        that Azure is unable to make the LTO Domain Name DNS available to Buyer after
        the first installment payment, Azure shall return any funds provided by buyer
        for the purchase of the LTO Domain Name as soon as commercially reasonably
        possible.</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(C) Fees and Payment.</strong></p>\\n<p>You
        are responsible for paying the monthly payment related to your LTO Domain
        plus any applicable Service Fee.</p>\\n<p>Any commissions may be subtracted
        from the payment, instalment payment or rental payment and, if these payments
        are not sufficient, from the subsequent payments. In the event that the domain
        name is purchased in instalments or rented, the commission subtracted will
        be limited to the secured instalment or rent payment (e.g.: if the commission
        is 25%, and the instalment price $100, the Azure only subtracts $25 from the
        payout of the Seller for each instalment.)</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(D)
        Your Additional Obligations.</strong></p>\\n<ol><li>Buyer agrees to use the
        LTO Domain only in accordance with any applicable laws and/or regulations,
        and with all duty and care. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer is prohibited
        from using the LTO Domain in a manner (as determined by Azure in its sole
        and absolute discretion) that:<ol type=a><li>in breach of any applicable law,
        statute, or regulation;</li><li>is fraudulent, criminal or unlawful;</li><li>promotes
        racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or
        individual;</li><li>infringes or breaches the patent, copyright, trademark,
        trade secret, right of publicity or other intellectual property) rights of
        any third party;</li><li>contains video, audio photographs, or images of another
        person without his or her permission (or in the case of a minor, the minor's
        legal guardian\u2019s permission);</li><li>provides information on any illegal
        activity (including, but not limited to, instructional information on acquiring
        or fabricating illegal weapons or drugs, privacy violations or distributing
        computer viruses);</li><li>publicizes or promotes commercial activities an/or
        sales without our prior written consent such as contests, sweepstakes, barter,
        advertising, and pyramid schemes; or</li><li>involves the use, delivery or
        transmission of any viruses, harmful code, unsolicited emails, Trojan horses
        or any other computer programming routines that are intended to disrupt, damage,
        detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any
        system, data or personal information.</li></ol></li><li>Buyer acknowledges
        and agrees not to engage in any activity with the LTO Domain or using the
        LTO Services that would decrease the value of the LTO Domain. Such activities
        include, but are not limited to, the use of aggressive SEO strategies, techniques
        and tactics that focus only on search engines and not a human audience, and
        usually does not obey search engines guidelines (black hat SEO), such as keyword
        stuffing, invisible text, doorway pages, adding unrelated keywords to the
        page content or page swapping (changing the webpage entirely after it has
        been ranked by search engines), and the use of the domain name for spam activities.</li><li>Buyer
        may not grant any third party any rights to the LTO Domain, including any
        right to use the LTO Domain.</li><li>\\tBuyer agrees to protect, defend, indemnity
        and hold harmless Azure and its officers, directors, employees, agents and
        third party service providers from and against any and all claims, demands,
        costs, expenses, losses liabilities and damages of every kind and nature (including,
        without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) imposed upon or incurred
        by Azure directly or indirectly arising from (i) your use of the LTO Services;
        (ii) your violation(s) of any provision of this Agreement; and/or (iii) your
        violation of any third party right, including without limitation any intellectual
        property or other proprietary right. This indemnification obligation shall
        survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or your use of the
        LTO Services.</li></ol>\\r\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>E. Azure\u2019s Rights.</strong></p>\\n<ol><li>Azure
        may terminate your use of the LTO Services for any violation or breach of
        any of the terms of this Agreement by you. Any such termination will not entitle
        you to any refund of payments already made to Azure for any LTO Services or
        Service Fee, and you will lose any and all access to the applicable LTO Domain.</li><li>If
        the LTO Services are terminated, Azure reserves the right to sell the LTO
        Domain to any party, including potential competitors of Buyer. Azure shall
        have no ongoing obligation to Buyer related to the LTO Domain.</li><li>The
        parties acknowledge and agree that the Azure is not a payment provider and
        that Azure does not make any warranties in that respect. In order to effectuate
        the transfer of payments, Azure uses the services of a third party payment
        provider. The terms and conditions of the third party payment provider shall
        apply to such payments.</li></ol>\\r\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>F. Remedies
        and Right to Cancel.</strong></p>\\n<p>Without limiting any other remedies
        available to Azure, if:</p>\\n<ol type=A><li>You breach this Agreement, or
        any document incorporated by reference;</li><li>Azure determines your actions
        may pose a risk to Azure or its members;</li><li>Azure determines your use
        of the Services infringes on the intellectual property or legal rights of
        others.</li></ol>\\r\\n<p>Azure may immediately:</p>\\n<ol type=i><li>Warn
        its members of your actions;</li><li>Place a hold on any pending transactions
        associated with your account(s);</li><li>Limit funding sources and payments;</li><li>Limit
        your access to your account(s) or to any functionality of your account(s);
        or</li><li>Indefinitely suspend or close your account(s) and refuse to provide
        our Services to you.</li></ol><p></li></ol></p>\\n<p>In addition, Azure reserves
        the right to hold funds beyond normal distribution periods for transactions
        it deems suspicious or for account(s) conducting high transaction volumes
        to ensure integrity of the funds. If Azure closes your account(s), Azure will
        provide notice and pay you all of the unrestricted funds in your account(s)
        due to you.</p>\\n</p>\\n</div>\\n\",\"url\":\"http://www.secureserver.net/agreements/ShowDoc.aspx?pageid=reg_sa&pl_id=510456\"},{\"agreementKey\":\"DNPA\",\"title\":\"Domains

        . COMMUNICATIONS FORWARDING</strong> </strong>\\n\\n      <p><p><strong>a.
        Correspondence Forwarding</strong>  \\r</p>\\n<p>Inasmuch as Azure's name,
        postal address and phone number will be listed in the Whois directory, You
        agree Azure will review and forward communications addressed to Your domain
        name that are received via email, certified or traceable courier mail (such
        as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or first class U.S. postal mail. You specifically
        acknowledge Azure will not forward to You first class postal mail (other than
        legal notices), &quot;junk&quot; mail or other unsolicited communications
        (whether delivered through email, fax, postal mail or telephone), and You
        further authorize Azure to either discard all such communications or return
        all such communications to sender unopened. You agree to waive any and all
        claims arising from Your failure to receive communications directed to Your
        domain name but not forwarded to You by Azure. <br />\\n</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>b.
        Email Forwarding</strong><br />\\n<br />\\nThe Whois directory requires an
        email address for every purchased domain name registration. When You purchase
        a private domain registration, Azure creates a private email address for that
        domain name, &quot;@domainsbyproxy.com&quot;. Thereafter, when messages are
        sent to that private email address, Azure handles them according to the email
        preference You selected for that particular domain name. You have three (3)
        email preferences from which to choose. You can elect to:<br />\\n</p>\\n<ol
        type=i><li>Have all of the messages forwarded;</li><li> Have all of the messages
        filtered for Spam and then forwarded; or</li><li>Have none of the messages
        forwarded.</li></ol>\\r\\n<p><br />\\nAs with all communications, You agree
        to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive email directed
        to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by Azure.</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>c.
        Notifications Regarding Correspondence and Your Obligation to Respond</strong></p>\\n<p>When
        Azure receives certified or traceable courier mail or legal notices addressed
        to Your domain name, in most cases, Azure will attempt to forward the mail
        to you via email. If You do not respond to the Azure email and/or the correspondence
        Azure has received regarding Your domain name registration concerns a dispute
        of any kind or otherwise requires immediate disposition, Azure may immediately
        reveal Your identity and/or cancel the Azure private registration service
        regarding either the domain name registration(s) in question. This means the
        Whois directory will revert to displaying Your name, postal address, email
        address and phone number that you provided to Azure.  </p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>d.
        Additional Administrative Fees</strong><br />\\n<br />\\nAzure reserves the
        right to charge You reasonable &quot;administrative fees&quot; or &quot;processing
        fees&quot; for (i)  tasks Azure may perform outside the normal scope of its
        Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs Azure may incur in providing its
        Services, and/or (iii) Your non-compliance with the Agreement (as determined
        by Azure in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing
        fee scenarios include, but are not limited to, (i) customer service issues
        that require additional personal time and attention; (ii) disputes that require
        accounting or legal services, whether performed by Azure staff or by outside
        firms retained by Azure; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including
        the cost of DBP Services, incurred by Azure as the result of chargebacks or
        other payment disputes brought by You, Your bank or Payment Method processor.
        \ These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment
        Method You have on file with Your Registrar.</p>\\n<p>You agree to waive the
        right to trial by jury in any proceeding that takes place relating to or arising
        out of this Agreement.</p>\\n</p>\\n        <strong><strong>6 . LIMITATIONS
