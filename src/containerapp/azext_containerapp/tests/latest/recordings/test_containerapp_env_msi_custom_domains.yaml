        Domain Name Registration Agreement (this &quot;<u>Agreement</u>&quot;) is
        entered into by and between Microsoft Azure (&quot;Azure&quot;) and you, and
        is made effective as of the date of electronic acceptance.  This Agreement
        sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of Azure's Domain Name Registration
        services (the &quot;<u>Domain Name Registration Services</u>&quot; or the
        &quot;<u>Services</u>&quot;). The terms &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or
        &quot;our&quot; shall refer to Azure.  The terms &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;,
        &quot;User&quot; or &quot;customer&quot; shall refer to any individual or
        entity who accepts this Agreement.  Unless otherwise specified, nothing in
        this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</p>\\n
        \     <p>Your electronic acceptance of this Agreement signifies that you have
        read, understand, acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Agreement, which
        incorporates by reference each of (i) Azure\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/universal-terms-of-service-agreement?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Universal

        discretion, may change or modify this Agreement, and any policies or agreements
        which are incorporated herein, at any time, and such changes or modifications

        \ In addition, Azure may occasionally notify you of changes or modifications
        to this Agreement by email.  It is therefore very important that you keep
        your shopper account (\u201C<u>Shopper Account</u>\u201D) information, including
        your email address, current.  Azure assumes no liability or responsibility
        for your failure to receive an email notification if such failure results
        from an inaccurate or out-of-date email address.  Azure is an Internet Corporation
        for Assigned Names and Numbers (&quot;<u>ICANN</u>&quot;) accredited registrar.
        \ \\r</p>\\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that Azure may modify this Agreement
        in order to comply with any terms and conditions set forth by (i) ICANN and/or
        (ii) the registry applicable to the TLD or country code top level domain (&quot;<u>ccTLD</u>&quot;)
        in question. The term \u201CRegistry Service Provider\u201D shall refer to
        the service provider responsible for operating and managing the registry services
        on behalf of the Registry Operator for its applicable TLD or ccTLD.  To identify

        \       <strong><strong>2. PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO ALL REGISTRATIONS</strong>
        \ </strong>\\n\\n      <p><p><em>Unless otherwise noted, the provisions below
        in this Section 2 are generally applicable to all TLDs that we offer.  Special
        provisions specific to any TLD or ccTLD (those in addition to posted Registry
        Policies) are identified elsewhere below in this Agreement.</em>  \\r</p>\\n<p><ol><li><em><u>Registry
        Policies.</u></em> You agree to be bound by all Registry Policies (defined
        above in this Agreement) applicable to your domain name registration (at any
        level). IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO VISIT THE APPLICABLE TLD SITE AND READ
        AND REVIEW ALL APPLICABLE REGISTRY POLICIES PRIOR TO YOUR REGISTRATION IN
        THE TLD.  REGISTRY POLICIES FOR EACH TLD CAN BE FOUND BY VISITING THE CORRESPONDING
        TLD LINK LISTED<a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/tld-registry-policies?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">HERE</a>.
        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Registry Operator
        of the TLD in which the domain name registration is made is and shall be an
        intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement. As such the parties to
        this agreement acknowledge and agree that the third party beneficiary rights
        of the Registry Operator have vested and that the Registry Operator has relied
        on its third party beneficiary rights under this Agreement in agreeing to
        Azure being a registrar for the respective TLD. The third party beneficiary
        rights of the Registry Operator will survive any termination of this Agreement.</li>
        \ </p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Registration Requirements.</u></em> To
        the extent any TLD or ccTLD requires you meet eligibility (e.g., residency
        for .JP, .EU, etc.), validation (e.g., DNS validation) or other authentication
        requirements as a condition to registering a domain name in the TLD, you agree
        that by submitting an application or registering or renewing your domain name,
        you represent and warrant that: (a) all information provided to register or
        renew the domain name (including all supporting documents, if any) is true,
        complete and correct, and is not misleading in any way, and the application
        is made in good faith; (b) you meet, and will continue to meet, the eligibility
        criteria prescribed in the Registry Policies for the applicable TLD for the
        duration of the domain name registration; (c) you have not previously submitted
        an application for the domain name with another registrar using the same eligibility
        criteria, and the other registrar has rejected the application (if applicable);
        (d) you acknowledge and agree that even if the domain name is accepted for
        registration, your entitlement to register the domain name may be challenged
        by others who claim to have an entitlement to the domain name; and (e) you
        acknowledge and agree that the Registry or the registrar can cancel the registration
        of the domain name if any of the warranties required are found to be untrue,
        incomplete, incorrect or misleading.</li>  </p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Ownership.</u></em>
        You acknowledge and agree that registration of a domain name does not create
        any proprietary right for you, the registrar, or any other person in the name
        used as a domain name or the domain name registration and that the entry of
        a domain name in the Registry shall not be construed as evidence or ownership
        of the domain name registered as a domain name. You shall not in any way transfer
        or purport to transfer a proprietary right in any domain name registration
        or grant or purport to grant as security or in any other manner encumber or
        purport to encumber a domain name registration.</li>  \\r</p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>ICANN
        Requirements.</u></em> You agree to comply with the ICANN requirements, standards,
        policies, procedures, and practices for which each applicable Registry Operator
        has monitoring responsibility in accordance with the Registry Agreement between
        ICANN and itself or any other arrangement with ICANN. For additional ICANN-related
        helpful information, please see <a href=\\\"https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/educational-2012-02-25-en\\\">ICANN

        Benefits and Responsibilities</a>.</li>  \\r</p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Indemnification
        of Registry.</u></em>  You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (within
        30 days of demand) the Registry Operator and Registry Service Provider and
        their subcontractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, divisions, shareholders, directors,
        officers, employees, accountants, attorneys, insurers, agents, predecessors,
        successors and assigns, from and against any and all claims, demands, damages,
        losses, costs, expenses, causes of action or other liabilities of any kind,
        whether known or unknown, including reasonable legal and attorney\u2019s fees
        and expenses, in any way arising out of, relating to, or otherwise in connection
        with the your domain name registration, including, without limitation, the
        use, registration, extension, renewal, deletion, and/or transfer thereof and/or
        the violation of any applicable terms or conditions governing the registration.
        You shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any such indemnifiable
        claim without Registrar\u2019s or Registry Operator\u2019s prior written consent,
        which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and you agree that these
        indemnification obligations shall survive the termination or expiration of
        the Agreement for any reason.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE REGISTRY OPERATOR BE
        LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
        SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFIT OR GOODWILL,
        FOR ANY MATTER, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS ASSERTED ON THE BASIS OF CONTRACT,
        TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
        ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS INCORPORATED AGREEMENTS AND POLICIES YOUR
        INABILITY TO USE THE DOMAIN NAME, YOUR LOSS OF DATA OR FILES OR OTHERWISE,
        EVEN IF THE REGISTRY OPERATOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.</li>  \\r</p>\\n      <p><li><em><u>Regulated TLDs.</u></em> For
        domain name registration in any \u201CRegulated\u201D TLD, you acknowledge
        and agree your registration is subject to the following additional requirements:
        (a) comply with all applicable laws, including those that relate to privacy,
        data collection, consumer protection (including in relation to misleading
        and deceptive conduct), fair lending, debt collection, organic farming, disclosure
        of data, and financial disclosures; (b) if you collect and maintain sensitive

        In addition to the requirements for Regulated and Highly-Regulated TLDs, by
        registering a domain name in any \u201CSpecial-Safeguard\u201D TLD, you agree
        to take reasonable steps to avoid misrepresenting or falsely implying that
        you or your business is affiliated with, sponsored or endorsed by one or more
        country's or government's military forces if such affiliation, sponsorship

        third party beneficiary of this Agreement. As such the parties to this agreement
        acknowledge and agree that the third party beneficiary rights of the Registry
        Operator have vested and that the Registry Operator has relied on its third

        renewal registration pricing (such that the Fee for a domain name registration
        renewal may differ from other domain names in the same TLD, e.g., renewal
        registration for one domain may be $100.00 and $33.00 for a different domain

        \     <p><p><strong>(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS</strong></p>\\n<p>You
        agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained
        at this Site at the time you order the Services.  Azure expressly reserves
        the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes
        or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately
        without need for further notice to you.  If you have purchased or obtained
        Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices
        and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal
        as further described below.   \\r</p>\\n<p>Unless otherwise specifically noted
        (for reasons such as those highlighted in Section 2(x) above), the renewal
        price for any domain name in any TLD will be the same as the list (non-sale)
        price shown when you search for and select a domain, and again in the cart
        prior to purchase.  For example, if the list price is $9.99, and a different
        renewal price is not specifically identified, then the renewal price is also
        $9.99.  Likewise, if a domain name has a sale price of $8.99, with the list
        (non-sale) price shown (as a strike-through) at $9.99, the renewal price will
        be $9.99*.  \\r</p>\\n<p><small>* Renewal price subject to change prior to
        actual date of renewal.</small>  \\r</p>\\n<p>For all other terms and conditions
        relating to fees, payment, refund and billing, etc. applicable to the Services
        offered under the scope of this Agreement, please refer to the \u201CFees
        and Payments\u201D section of our <a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/universal-terms-of-service-agreement?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Universal
        Terms of Service</a>.   \\r</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(B) DOMAIN NAME
        RENEWAL TERMS</strong></p>\\n<p>When you register a domain name, you will
        have the following renewal options: </p>\\n<p><ol><li><em>Automatic Renewal.</em>
        Automatic Renewal is the default setting. Domain names will automatically
        renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name
        registration, and payment will be taken from the Payment Method you have on
        file with Azure, at Azure's then current rates. Thus, if you have chosen to
        register your domain name for one (1) year, Azure will automatically renew
        it for one (1) year. If you have chosen to register your domain name for two
        (2) years, Azure will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.
        If you wish to change your automatic renewal term to a different period from
        your original term,  as of 16 July 2020, you may manually renew the domain
        registration to establish a new default automatic renewal term for the domain.</li></p>\\n</p>\\n
        \     <p><li><em>Manual Renewal.</em>  If you have elected to turn off automatic
        renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel the domain name registration)
        effective at expiration of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect
        to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its expiration date
        by logging into your <a href=\\\"https://account.secureserver.net?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Account
        Manager</a> and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service
        (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed). If you fail to manually
        implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be
        cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</li></ol> </p>\\n
        \     <p>All renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it
        may be amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound
        by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.  Domain
        name renewals will be non-refundable. In the event that we are unable to automatically
        renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we
        may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than your original
        registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.
        If for any reason Azure is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method
        you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name
        registration will expire. It is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method
        information current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a
        credit card.  \\r</p>\\n      <p><p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .br,

        .uk, and .vg), renewal billing will occur on the first day of the month prior
        to the month of expiration.</p>\\n<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .ca,

        and .vg), renewal will occur, or must occur manually if the product was previously
        cancelled, no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date,
        or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status. For some ccTLDs
        (.es) renewal must be processed no later than seven days before the expiration
        date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.  When the
        domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by
        calling Azure and requesting that the domain name be renewed. You cannot renew
        the domain name through your <a href=\\\"https://account.secureserver.net?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Account
        Manager</a>. If you fail to manually implement the renewal of any cancelled
        product before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and
        you will no longer have use of that name.  \\r</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p>You agree
        that Azure will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail
        to renew in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement. In any case, if you
        fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may
        apply. If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any
        other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services
        will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for
        renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you
        cancel in advance. </p>\\n      <p><p>If you fail to renew your domain name
        in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that Azure may, in
        its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf. If Azure
        decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a
        Renewal Grace Period during which you must reimburse Azure for the renewal
        and keep your domain name. The Renewal Grace Period is currently twelve (12)
        days but subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. </p>\\n<p>For
        certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm,
        .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw,
        .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg) there is no Renewal Grace Period
        after the expiration date of the domain name. If you do not reimburse Azure
        for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed
        on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption
        period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject
        to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay Azure a Redemption fee.
        </p>\\n<p>The Redemption fee is displayed at checkout and is subject to change
        under the terms of this Agreement. If you do not redeem your domain name prior
        to the end of the 30-day redemption period Azure may, in its sole discretion,
        delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.
        \ During the redemption period your domain name may be parked.</p>\\n</p>\\n
        \     <p><p>If your domain name is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30-day
        Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay Azure a redemption fee and
        redeem your domain name. The redemption fee is displayed at checkout and is
        subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. If you do not redeem
        your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period
        the Registry will release your name and it will become available for registration
        on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>\\n<p>Renewal Grace Periods and Redemption
        Grace Periods vary for different ccTLDs. Please refer to the specific terms
        for the applicable TLD. In the event there is a conflict between the provisions
        of this paragraph and the ccTLD terms, the ccTLD terms shall control.</p>\\n<p>Our

        the event you are provided with free products with the registration of a domain
        name, you acknowledge and agree that such free products will only be available
        with a valid purchase and may be terminated in the event the domain name is
        deleted or cancelled.  For free domain names, you acknowledge and agree that
        you may not change the account associated with such free domain for the first
        five (5) days after registration.  In the event a free domain name is offered
        with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered
        fails, then we may, in our sole discretion, either delete the registration
        of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the
        value of the free domain.  Failed registrations associated with promotional
        offers may result in the deletion of the free or discounted item or an adjustment
        between the registered domain price and the value of the discounted item,
        in our sole discretion.</p>\\n</p>\\n        <strong><strong>4. TERM OF AGREEMENT;
        TRANSFERS; DOMAIN TASTING</strong>  </strong>\\n\\n      <p>The term of this
        Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as you have any
        domain name registered through Azure.  \\r</p>\\n      <p>You agree that you
        will not transfer any domain name registered through Azure to another domain
        name registrar during the first sixty (60) days after its initial registration
        date.  You agree that you may not transfer any domain name for ten (10) days
        after a Change of Account.  \\r</p>\\n      <p>You further agree that you
        will not engage in &quot;domain tasting&quot; by using the five (5) day grace
        period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain name and get a
        full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the marketability
        or viability of a domain name.  If Azure determines (which determination shall
        be made by Azure in its sole and absolute discretion) that you have been engaging
        in &quot;domain tasting&quot;, then Azure reserves the right to (a) charge
        you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any refund issued) or (b)
        refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether. Azure will not charge
        you a fee if Azure cancels your domain name during the five (5) day grace
        period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control. The five (5)
        day grace period does not apply to Premium Domains, which are non-refundable.
        \ \\r</p>\\n      <p>You agree that Azure shall not be bound by (i) any representations
        made by third parties who you may use to purchase services from Azure, or
        (ii) any statements of a general nature, which may be posted on Azure's website
        or contained in Azure's promotional materials.</p>\\n        <strong><strong>5.

        of the information you provided as part of the application and/or registration

        and accurate status. Failure by you, for whatever reason, to provide Azure
        with accurate and reliable information on an initial and continual basis,
        shall be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis
        for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name. Failure by you, for
        whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries
        made by Azure to determine the validity of information provided by you, shall
        also be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for

        full contact information and updating accurate technical and administrative
        contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems
        that arise in connection with the Registered Name. A Registered Name Holder
        licensing use of a Registered Name according to this provision shall accept
        liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the Registered Name, unless it
        disclosers the current contact information provided by the licensee and the

        DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY</strong></strong>\\n\\n      <p>You agree to be

        Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</a> online. You agree that Azure may
        from time to time modify its Dispute Resolution Policy. Azure will post any
        changes to its Dispute Resolution Policy at least thirty (30) days before
        they become effective. You agree that by maintaining your domain name registrations
        with Azure after the updated policy becomes effective that you agree to the
        Dispute Resolution policy as amended. You agree to review Azure's website
        periodically to determine if changes have been made to the Dispute Resolution
        Policy. If you cancel or terminate your Services with Azure as a result of
        the modified Dispute Resolution policy, no fees will be refunded to you. You
        also agree to submit to proceedings commenced under ICANN's Uniform Rapid
        Suspension System, if applicable. </p>\\n      <p>You agree that if a dispute
        arises as a result of one (1) or more domain names you have registered using
        Azure, you will indemnify, defend and hold Azure harmless as provided for
        in this Agreement. You also agree that if Azure is notified that a complaint
        has been filed with a governmental, administrative or judicial body, regarding
        a domain name registered by you using Azure, that Azure, in its sole discretion,
        may take whatever action Azure deems necessary regarding further modification,
        assignment of and/or control of the domain name deemed necessary to comply
        with the actions or requirements of the governmental, administrative or judicial
        body until such time as the dispute is settled. In this event you agree to
        hold Azure harmless for any action taken by Azure.</p>\\n      <p>You agree
        to submit, without prejudice to other potentially applicable jurisdictions,
        to the jurisdiction of the courts (1) of your domicile, (2) where registrar

        .CN, Columbia for .CO, UK for .EU, etc.).</p>\\n      <p>In the case of .ca
        domain names, you agree that, if your use of the service or the registration
        of a .ca domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to

        or transferred to Azure shall be placed on lock status, unless an opted-out
        has occurred as defined in our Change of Registrant Agreement or Domain Name
        Proxy Agreement. The domain name must be placed on unlock status in order
        to initiate a transfer of the domain name away from Azure to a new Registrar.
        You may log into your account with Azure at any time after your domain name
        has been successfully transferred to Azure, and change the status to unlock.</p>\\n

        not limited to those relating to privacy, data collection, consumer protection,
        fair lending, debt collection, organic farming, and disclosure of data and
        financial disclosures.  If you collect and maintain sensitive health and financial
        data, you must implement reasonable and appropriate security measures commensurate
        with the offering of those services, as defined by applicable law.  You represent
        that you possess any necessary authorization, charter, license, and/or other
        related credential for participation in the sector associated with the associated
        registry tld string.  You will report any material changes to the validity
        of your authorization, charter, license, and/or other related credential.
        You will indemnify and hold harmless the registrar and registry operator,
        and their directors, officers, employees and agents, from and against any
        and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable
        legal fees and expenses) arising out of or related to the domain name registration.

        of either Azure or the registry: (i) to comply with specifications adopted
        by any industry group generally recognized as authoritative with respect to
        the Internet (e.g., RFCs), (ii) to protect the integrity and stability of,
        and correct mistakes made by, any domain name registry or registrar, (iii)
        for the non-payment of fees to registry, (iv) to protect the integrity and
        stability of the registry, (v) to comply with any applicable court orders,

        dispute resolution process, (vi) to comply with any applicable ICANN rules
        or regulations, including without limitation, the registry agreement, (vii)
        to avoid any liability, civil or criminal, on the part of registry operator,
        as well as its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, and employees,
        (viii) per the terms of this Agreement, (ix) following an occurrence of any

        Azure rule or policy may be considered by Azure to be a material breach of
        this Agreement and Azure may provide you with notice of such breach either
        in writing or electronically (i.e. email). In the event you do not provide
        Azure with material evidence that you have not breached your obligations to
        Azure within ten (10) business days, Azure may terminate its relationship
        with you and take any remedial action available to Azure under the applicable
        laws. Such remedial action may be implemented without notice to you and may
        include, but is not limited to, cancelling the registration of any of your
        domain names and discontinuing any services provided by Azure to you. No fees
        will be refunded to you should your Services be cancelled or terminated because
        of a breach.</p>\\n<p>Azure's failure to act upon or notify you of any event,
        which may constitute a breach, shall not relieve you from or excuse you of
        the fact that you have committed a breach.</p>\\n</p>\\n        <strong><strong>9.
        RESTRICTION OF SERVICES; RIGHT OF REFUSAL</strong></strong>\\n\\n      <p>If
        you are hosting your domain name system (\u201C<u>DNS</u>\u201D) on Azure\u2019s
        servers, or are using our systems to forward a domain name, URL, or otherwise
        to a system or site hosted elsewhere, or if you have your domain name registered
        with Azure, you are responsible for ensuring there is no excessive overloading
        on Azure\u2019s servers. You may not use Azure\u2019s servers and your domain
        name as a source, intermediary, reply to address, or destination address for
        mail bombs, Internet packet flooding, packet corruption, or other abusive
        attack. Server hacking or other perpetration of security breaches is prohibited.
        You agree that Azure reserves the right to deactivate your domain name from
        its DNS if Azure deems it is the recipient of activities caused by your site
        that threaten the stability of its network.</p>\\n      <p><p>You agree that
        Azure, in its sole discretion and without liability to you, may refuse to
        accept the registration of any domain name. Azure also may in its sole discretion
        and without liability to you delete the registration of any domain name during
        the first thirty (30) days after registration has taken place.</p>\\n<p>In
        the event Azure refuses a registration or deletes an existing registration
        during the first thirty (30) days after registration, you will receive a refund
        of any fees paid to Azure in connection with the registration either being
        cancelled or refused. In the event Azure deletes the registration of a domain
        name being used in association with spam or morally objectionable activities,
        no refund will be issued.</p>\\n</p>\\n        <strong><strong>10. DEFAULT
        SETTINGS; PARKED PAGE</strong></strong>\\n\\n      <p><u>Choosing Your Domain
        Name Settings.</u>  When you register a domain name with Azure, you will be
        prompted to choose your domain name settings during the checkout process.
        \ If you plan on using another provider for your website or hosting needs,
        then you should enter the name servers of such provider when you choose your
        domain name settings.  This will direct your domain name away from Azure\u2019s
        name servers.  If you are an existing Azure customer and have already set
        up a customer profile designating your domain name settings for new domain
        name registrations, you will not need to complete this step again during the
        checkout process.   </p>\\n      <p><u>Azure\u2019s Default Settings.</u>
        \ If you do not direct your domain name away from Azure\u2019s name servers
        as described above, Azure will direct your domain name to a \u201C<u>Parked
        Page</u>\u201D (\u201C<u>Default Setting</u>\u201D).  You acknowledge and
        agree that Azure has the right to set the Default Setting. </p>\\n      <p><u>Parked
        Page Default Setting.</u>  Azure's Parked Page service is an online domain
        monetization system designed to generate revenue (through the use of pay per
        click advertising) from domain names that are not actively being used as websites.
        \ If your domain name is directed to a Parked Page, you acknowledge and agree
        that Azure may display both (a) in-house advertising (which includes links
        to Azure products and services) and (b) third-party advertising (which includes
        links to third-party products and services) on your Parked Page through the
        use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or
        video streams, or any other advertising means, and we may aggregate for our
        own use, related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means.  In
        addition, you acknowledge and agree that all in-house and third-party advertising
        will be selected by Azure and its advertising partners, as appropriate, and
        you will not be permitted to customize the advertising, or entitled to any
        compensation in exchange therefor.  Please note that the third-party advertising
        displayed on Azure\u2019s Parked Pages may contain content offensive to you,
        including but not limited to links to adult content.  Azure  makes no effort
        to edit, control, monitor, or restrict the content and third-party advertising
        displayed on Azure\u2019s Parked Pages, and expressly disclaims any liability
        or responsibility to you or any third party in connection therewith.</p>\\n

        In Domain Name Monetization.</u>  If you wish to participate in the domain

        you.</li></ol></p>\\n      <p><u>Return To Parked Page Default Setting Upon
        Domain Name Expiration.</u>  Upon domain name expiration, and regardless of
        how you use your domain name during the term of your domain name registration,
        your domain name will automatically return to the Parked Page Default Setting
        described above.  As used in this paragraph, \u201Cexpiration\u201D is deemed
        to include any \u201Crenewal period\u201D or \u201Credemption period\u201D
        immediately after the domain name expires, but before the domain name is returned
        to the registry.  Once your domain name has returned to the Parked Page Default
        Setting described above, the only way to opt out of the Parked Page service
        is to renew, redeem, or re-register your domain name in accordance with Section

        Your domains forward in time, at least one (1) month forward and no more than
        ten (10) years forward, and then, only for a period lasting less than twelve
        (12) months. Once the service has been used to consolidate domains, the new
        expiration date may not be reversed. To ensure the service is not abused or
        used as an alternative to renewals, you may only use the service on each domain
        once in any 12-month period. The service may only be used on domain names
        that have not passed their expiration date. In order to change the expiration
        date again, You will be required to renew the domain name first.  You further
        understand and acknowledge the service may only be used to coordinate domains

        is provided to facilitate the buying of currently registered domain names
        only, and not the purchase or sale of associated website content.. Azure provides
        a venue and a transaction facilitation process and will take a stated commission
        for each completed transaction. Azure is not an escrow agent. As a result,
        Azure does not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of many of the domain
        names. Domain names listed may be withdrawn at any time by the seller or by
        us.  You acknowledge and agree that your transaction will be handled by Azure's
        \u201CTransaction Assurance\u201D process. By using Azure's \u201CTransaction
        Assurance\u201D process, you authorize Azure to perform tasks on your behalf
        in order to complete the transaction.  In these transactions, Azure acts as
        a transaction facilitator to help you buy and sell domain names. Azure will

        date. In the event you decide not to renew your one-year .INFO domain name
        for a second year, your domain name registration will automatically revert
        back to us and we will gain full rights of registration to such domain name.
        You agree that if you delete or transfer your .INFO domain name during the
        first year, you will automatically be charged the second year renewal fees.</p>\\n

        is a registration designed for the protection of trademarks and service marks
        and may be granted to prevent a third party from registering a variation of
        a trademark or the exact trademark. If the name you wish to register is subject
        to a Defensive Registration, you have three (3) options: (i) you may register
        a variation of the name, (ii) you may challenge the Defensive Registration
        under the <a href=\\\"https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/erdrp-2012-02-25-en\\\">Eligibility
        Requirements Dispute Resolution Policy</a>, or (iii) you may request Consent
        from the Defensive Registrant. You can request Consent by contacting the Defensive
        Registrant listed in the GNR Whois Directory and requesting consent to register
        the .NAME domain name. If the Defensive Registrant grants consent, they must
        confirm in writing that they grant consent. If the Defensive Registrant does
        not grant consent, you may wish to challenge the Defensive Registration under
        the ERDRP.</p>\\n      <p><u><em>Acceptable Use Policy</em></u>.  You agree

        means .au Domain Administration Limited ACN 079 009 340, the .au domain names
        administrator.  The Registrar acts as agent for auDA for the sole purpose,
        but only to the extent necessary, to enable auDA to receive the benefit of
        rights and covenants conferred to it under this Agreement. auDA is an intended
        third party beneficiary of this agreement.<br />\\n<br />\\n<u>auDA Published

        auDA may delete or cancel the registration of a .au domain name. <br />\\n<br
        />\\n<u>auDA's Liabilities and Indemnity</u>.  To the fullest extent permitted
        by law, auDA will not be liable to Registrant for any direct, indirect, consequential,
        special, punitive or exemplary losses or damages of any kind (including, without
        limitation, loss of use, loss or profit, loss or corruption of data, business
        interruption or indirect costs) suffered by Registrant arising from, as a
        result of, or otherwise in connection with, any act or omission whatsoever
        of auDA, its employees, agents or contractors. Registrant agrees to indemnify,
        keep indemnified and hold auDA, its employees, agents and contractors harmless
        from all and any claims or liabilities, arising from, as a result of, or otherwise
        in connection with, Registrant's registration or use of its .au domain name.

        .CA REGISTRATIONS</em></strong><br />\\nYou acknowledge and agree that registration
        of your selected domain name in your first application to CIRA shall not be
        effective until you have entered into and agreed to be bound by CIRA's Registrant
        Agreement. <br />\\n<br />\\n<u><em>CIRA Certified Registrar</em></u>.  The

        longer a CIRA Certified Registrar, has had its certification as a CIRA Certified
        Registrar suspended or terminated, or the Registrar Agreement between CIRA
        and the Registrar is terminated or expires. CIRA may post notice of such suspension,
        termination, or expiry on its website and may, if CIRA deems appropriate,
        give notice to the registrants thereof. In the event that the registrar is
        no longer a CIRA Certified Registrar, has had its certification as a CIRA
        Certified Registrar suspended or terminated or in the event the Registrar
        Agreement between CIRA and the Registrar is terminated or expires, you shall

        CIRA may in its sole discretion stop accepting applications for domain name
        registrations from the registrar, stop effecting registrations of domain names
        and transfers, renewals, modifications, and cancellations requested by the
        registrar and stop performing other billable transactions requested by the
        registrar not paid in full and CIRA may terminate the Registrar Agreement
        between CIRA and the Registrar.<br />\\n<br />\\n<u><em>.CA ASCII and IDN
        domain variants</em></u> are bundled and reserved for a single registrant.
        \ Registrants are not required to register all variants in a bundle, but all
        registered variants must be registered and managed at a single registrar.
        Each variant registered will incur a registration fee.  In addition, when
        registering multiple .CA domain (ASCII and IDN) variants in a bundle, your
        registrant information <strong><em>must be identical</em></strong>.  If variants
        are registered at other registrars or if registrant information does not match,
        it may result in an &quot;unavailable&quot; search result, delayed or failed
        registration. If information does not match, validation is required and may
        take up to seven business days and delay availability of domain.</p>\\n</p>\\n

        name check <strong><em>and</em></strong> real name verification as required
        by the People\u2019s Republic of China.  Registrations in .CN are therefore
        subject to the following additional terms:</p>\\n<p><u><em>Verification, Registration
        and Activation</em></u>.  If a domain name is not permitted to be registered
        by the Chinese government, as determined by us, the Registry Operator and/or
        a 3rd party provider utilized for such services and determinations, in either
        party\u2019s discretion, the application for registration will not be successful.
        \ In such event, the name will be deleted and you will be eligible for a refund
        as further described below.</p>\\n<p>If permitted, then the Registration may
        proceed, but a .CN domain name may not be activated (i.e., it will not resolve
        in the Internet) <u><em>unless and until</em></u> you have submitted (via
        the process described during registration) valid documents required of us
        and the Registry to perform real name verification.  The following are acceptable
        forms of documents for the purpose of verification:\\r\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>China:
        Resident ID, temporary resident ID, business license or organization code
        certificate</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>Hong Kong/Macau: Resident ID, driver\u2019s

        Policy</a>.  By registering a .CN domain, you expressly agree that your data
        may be stored on servers in the U.S., or otherwise outside of the People's
        Republic of China.</p>\\n<p><u><em>Refunds</em></u>.  Refunds for .CN Registrations
        will only be allowed where (i) registration of the applied for domain name
        is not permitted by the Chinese government; or (ii) you notify us of your
        intent to cancel for any reason within the first five (5) days after the Registration
        (i.e., after it is deemed permissible by the Chinese government).  For the
        avoidance of doubt, refunds will not be permitted under any circumstances
        after five (5) days from the date of Registration, including, for example,
        in the event real name verification is not successful or if the Chinese government
        determines after Registration that the domain name should not have been registered
        (and directs us to delete).</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong><em>(D) PROVISIONS
        SPECIFIC TO .JP REGISTRATIONS</em></strong>  <br />\\n<u><em>Registration
        Restrictions</em></u>.  You represent and warrant that you have a local presence

        (i) TLDs, other than ccTLDs, as determined by ICANN; (ii) geographical-type
        .JP domain names that are defined as metropolitan, prefectural, and municipal
        labels; (iii) names of primary and secondary educational organizations; (iv)
        names of organizations related to Internet management; (v) names required

        with respect to Lease to Own Services (the \u201CLTO Services\u201D) provided
        by Azure, to you.</p>\\n<p><strong>(A) Definitions:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>LTO
        Domain</strong>: a domain name that you purchase from Azure through the Site
        with an agreement to pay over time.</li>\\n<li><strong>LTO Term</strong>:
        the period agreed between Azure and Buyer during which Buyer will have access
        to the DNS and will make monthly payments to Azure.</li>\\n<li><strong>Service
        Fee</strong>: fee owed by Buyer to Azure for the Services provided by Azure
        during the LTO Term, including, but not limited to, renewing the LTO Domain,
        providing administrative services related to the management of the LTO Domain,
        forwarding correspondence, etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(B)
        Description of Services.</strong> </p>\\n<p>The LTO Services are provided
        to facilitate the buying and selling of currently registered domain names
        through payments over time, and not the purchase or sale of associated website
        content.</p>\\n<p>As Buyer, you agree to purchase the LTO Domain from Azure.
        During the LTO Term, Azure will make the DNS for the LTO Domain available
        to Buyer. You are required to deposit the mutually agreed-upon price and Buyer\u2019s
        Service Fee, as established by Azure, as soon as practical after you agree
        to the purchase price, but in no event later than five (5) business days.
        At no time will Buyer be able to withdraw those funds or send the funds to
        another recipient unless the initial transaction is cancelled. You agree that
        Azure is not responsible for breach of contract based upon a failure to transfer
        the LTO Domain to Buyer after the first payment is deposited. In the event
        that Azure is unable to make the LTO Domain Name DNS available to Buyer after
        the first installment payment, Azure shall return any funds provided by buyer
        for the purchase of the LTO Domain Name as soon as commercially reasonably
        possible.</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(C) Fees and Payment.</strong></p>\\n<p>You
        are responsible for paying the monthly payment related to your LTO Domain
        plus any applicable Service Fee.</p>\\n<p>Any commissions may be subtracted
        from the payment, instalment payment or rental payment and, if these payments
        are not sufficient, from the subsequent payments. In the event that the domain
        name is purchased in instalments or rented, the commission subtracted will
        be limited to the secured instalment or rent payment (e.g.: if the commission
        is 25%, and the instalment price $100, the Azure only subtracts $25 from the
        payout of the Seller for each instalment.)</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>(D)
        Your Additional Obligations.</strong></p>\\n<ol><li>Buyer agrees to use the
        LTO Domain only in accordance with any applicable laws and/or regulations,
        and with all duty and care. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer is prohibited

        and absolute discretion) that:<ol type=a><li>in breach of any applicable law,

        activity (including, but not limited to, instructional information on acquiring

        and agrees not to engage in any activity with the LTO Domain or using the
        LTO Services that would decrease the value of the LTO Domain. Such activities
        include, but are not limited to, the use of aggressive SEO strategies, techniques
        and tactics that focus only on search engines and not a human audience, and
        usually does not obey search engines guidelines (black hat SEO), such as keyword
        stuffing, invisible text, doorway pages, adding unrelated keywords to the
        page content or page swapping (changing the webpage entirely after it has
        been ranked by search engines), and the use of the domain name for spam activities.</li><li>Buyer
        may not grant any third party any rights to the LTO Domain, including any
        right to use the LTO Domain.</li><li>\\tBuyer agrees to protect, defend, indemnity
        and hold harmless Azure and its officers, directors, employees, agents and

        without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) imposed upon or incurred
        by Azure directly or indirectly arising from (i) your use of the LTO Services;
        (ii) your violation(s) of any provision of this Agreement; and/or (iii) your
        violation of any third party right, including without limitation any intellectual

        LTO Services.</li></ol>\\r\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>E. Azure\u2019s Rights.</strong></p>\\n<ol><li>Azure
        may terminate your use of the LTO Services for any violation or breach of
        any of the terms of this Agreement by you. Any such termination will not entitle
        you to any refund of payments already made to Azure for any LTO Services or
        Service Fee, and you will lose any and all access to the applicable LTO Domain.</li><li>If
        the LTO Services are terminated, Azure reserves the right to sell the LTO
        Domain to any party, including potential competitors of Buyer. Azure shall
        have no ongoing obligation to Buyer related to the LTO Domain.</li><li>The
        parties acknowledge and agree that the Azure is not a payment provider and
        that Azure does not make any warranties in that respect. In order to effectuate
        the transfer of payments, Azure uses the services of a third party payment
        provider. The terms and conditions of the third party payment provider shall

        and Right to Cancel.</strong></p>\\n<p>Without limiting any other remedies
        available to Azure, if:</p>\\n<ol type=A><li>You breach this Agreement, or

        . COMMUNICATIONS FORWARDING</strong> </strong>\\n\\n      <p><p><strong>a.
        Correspondence Forwarding</strong>  \\r</p>\\n<p>Inasmuch as Azure's name,
        postal address and phone number will be listed in the Whois directory, You
        agree Azure will review and forward communications addressed to Your domain
        name that are received via email, certified or traceable courier mail (such
        as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or first class U.S. postal mail. You specifically
        acknowledge Azure will not forward to You first class postal mail (other than
        legal notices), &quot;junk&quot; mail or other unsolicited communications
        (whether delivered through email, fax, postal mail or telephone), and You
        further authorize Azure to either discard all such communications or return
        all such communications to sender unopened. You agree to waive any and all
        claims arising from Your failure to receive communications directed to Your
        domain name but not forwarded to You by Azure. <br />\\n</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>b.
        Email Forwarding</strong><br />\\n<br />\\nThe Whois directory requires an
        email address for every purchased domain name registration. When You purchase
        a private domain registration, Azure creates a private email address for that
        domain name, &quot;@domainsbyproxy.com&quot;. Thereafter, when messages are
        sent to that private email address, Azure handles them according to the email
        preference You selected for that particular domain name. You have three (3)
        email preferences from which to choose. You can elect to:<br />\\n</p>\\n<ol
        type=i><li>Have all of the messages forwarded;</li><li> Have all of the messages
        filtered for Spam and then forwarded; or</li><li>Have none of the messages
        forwarded.</li></ol>\\r\\n<p><br />\\nAs with all communications, You agree
        to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive email directed
        to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by Azure.</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>c.
        Notifications Regarding Correspondence and Your Obligation to Respond</strong></p>\\n<p>When
        Azure receives certified or traceable courier mail or legal notices addressed
        to Your domain name, in most cases, Azure will attempt to forward the mail
        to you via email. If You do not respond to the Azure email and/or the correspondence
        Azure has received regarding Your domain name registration concerns a dispute
        of any kind or otherwise requires immediate disposition, Azure may immediately
        reveal Your identity and/or cancel the Azure private registration service
        regarding either the domain name registration(s) in question. This means the
        Whois directory will revert to displaying Your name, postal address, email
        address and phone number that you provided to Azure.  </p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>d.

        right to charge You reasonable &quot;administrative fees&quot; or &quot;processing
        fees&quot; for (i)  tasks Azure may perform outside the normal scope of its
        Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs Azure may incur in providing its
        Services, and/or (iii) Your non-compliance with the Agreement (as determined
        by Azure in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing
        fee scenarios include, but are not limited to, (i) customer service issues
        that require additional personal time and attention; (ii) disputes that require
        accounting or legal services, whether performed by Azure staff or by outside
        firms retained by Azure; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including
        the cost of DBP Services, incurred by Azure as the result of chargebacks or
        other payment disputes brought by You, Your bank or Payment Method processor.
        \ These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment
        Method You have on file with Your Registrar.</p>\\n<p>You agree to waive the

        out of this Agreement.</p>\\n</p>\\n        <strong><strong>6 . LIMITATIONS

        . MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</strong> </strong>\\n\\n      <p><p><strong>a.
        Severability; Construction; Entire Agreement</strong><br />\\n<br />\\nIf
        any part of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, unenforceable or invalid,
        in whole or in part, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent
        necessary to make it legal, enforceable and valid, and the legality, enforceability
        and validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected
        or impaired. The headings herein will not be considered a part of this Agreement.
        You agree this Agreement, including the policies it incorporates by reference,
        constitute the complete and only Agreement between You and Azure regarding
        the services contemplated herein.   </p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>f. Term
        of Agreement; Survival</strong><br />\\n<br />\\nThe terms of this Agreement
        shall continue in full force and effect as long as Azure is the Registrant
        for any domain name on Your behalf. Sections 5 (Communications Forwarding),
        6 (Limitation of Liability), 7 (Indemnity), 8 (Warranty Disclaimer) and 10
        (Miscellaneous Provisions) shall survive any termination or expiration of
        this Agreement.</p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>b. Governing Law; Venue;
        Waiver Of Trial By Jury</strong><br />\\n<br />\\nThis Agreement shall be
        governed in all respects by the laws and judicial decisions of Maricopa County,
        Arizona, excluding its conflicts of laws rules. Except as provided immediately
        below, You agree that any action relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
        shall be brought exclusively in the courts of Maricopa County, Arizona. For
        the adjudication of domain name registration disputes, you agree to submit
        to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the U.S. District Court for the
        District of Arizona located in Phoenix, Arizona. You agree to waive the right
        to trial by jury in any proceeding, regardless of venue, that takes place
        relating to or arising out of this Agreement.  </p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>c.
        Notices</strong> <br />\\n<br />\\nAll notices from Azure to You will be sent
        to the email address You provided to Azure. Notices by email shall be deemed
        effective twenty-four (24) hours after the email is sent by Azure, unless
        Azure receives notice that the email address is invalid, in which event Azure
        may give You notice via first class or certified mail, return receipt requested.
        All notices from You to Azure shall be sent via certified mail, return receipt
        requested or traceable courier to:  \\r</p>\\n<p>Domains By Proxy, LLC<br

        (5) days after the date of mailing.  </p>\\n</p>\\n      <p><p><strong>d.
        Insurance</strong>  <br />\\n<br />\\nIn the unlikely event You lose Your
        domain name registration to a third party solely as a result of Azure's negligent
        actions (and absent fraud or other negligent or willful misconduct committed
        by a third party), You may be insured against such loss through Azure's Professional
        Liability Insurance Policy, which is currently underwritten by American International
        Insurance Company. Of course, every claim is subject to the then-carrier's
        investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding such claim. In
        the event You have reason to believe that circumstances exist which warrant
        the filing of an insurance claim, please send a written notice (specifying
        the basis for such claim), via certified mail, return receipt requested, to:<br
        />\\n<br />\\nAzure<br>\\r\\nAttn: Insurance Claims<br>\\r\\n100 S. Mill Ave<br>\\r\\nSuite

        Indemnification</strong> <br />\\n<br />\\nIn the unlikely event You lose
        Your domain name registration to a third party solely as a result of Azure's
        willful misconduct, Your Registrar (the &quot;Indemnifying Party&quot;) will
        indemnify and hold You harmless against any losses, damages or costs (including
        reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any claim, action, proceeding,
        suit or demand arising out of or related to the loss of Your domain name registration.
        Such indemnification obligations under this Section 10(e) are conditioned
        upon the following:<ol type=i><li>That You promptly give both Azure and the
        Indemnifying Party written notice of the claim, demand, or action and provide
        reasonable assistance to the Indemnifying Party, at its cost and expense,
        in connection therewith, and</li><li>That the Indemnifying Party has the right,
        at its option, to control and direct the defense to any settlement of such
        claim, demand, or action.</li></ol>  \\r</p>\\n<p>Any notice concerning indemnification
        shall, with respect to Azure, be sent in accordance with Section 10(c) of
        this Agreement. With respect to Your Registrar, notices regarding indemnification
        should be sent in accordance with the notification provisions contained in
        Your Registrar's Domain Name Registration Agreement.  </p>\\n</p>\\n</div>\\n\",\"url\":\"http://www.secureserver.net/agreements/ShowDoc.aspx?pageid=domain_nameproxy&pl_id=510456\"}],\"nextLink\":null,\"id\":null}"
